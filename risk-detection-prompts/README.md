# Prompt Examples for Risk Detection in E-commerce with LLMs

This repository contains a set of prompt examples used in the paper:

Risk Detection in E-commerce with LLMs: Annotation Challenges and Lessons from Real-world Business News

The goal of the study is to detect and classify risks in business news articles related to five major e-commerceâ€“linked steel companies: ArcelorMittal, Tata Steel, POSCO, NLMK, and ThyssenKrupp. We annotated 121 business news articles using the Cambridge Risk Taxonomy framework and evaluated the performance of two advanced large language models (LLMs) for few-shot risk detection and classification.

These prompt examples illustrate how we structured our inputs for:

- Few-shot classification  
- Risk taxonomy alignment  
- Semantic similarity-based example selection

The full dataset of annotated articles is available upon request for research purposes. Please contact the corresponding author of the paper for access.
