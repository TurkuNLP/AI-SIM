While the news mentions NLMK’s interest in investing $1 billion in India, this is a significant financial commitment, and there are risks related to capital allocation and managing the return on investment in an emerging market. Entering a new market could involve risks like project delays, cost overruns, or failure to meet expected returns.

Class: Geopolitical, Family: Business Environment (Country Risk), comment: Market Entry & Political Risk, Naidu... met director of electrical steel division of NLMK Valery Shevelev, who informed him that the company is looking for possibilities of expansion in India and is keen to invest $1 billion.

Class: Financial, Family: Economic Outlook, comment: Expansion, Naidu... met director of electrical steel division of NLMK Valery Shevelev, who informed him that the company is looking for possibilities of expansion in India and is keen to invest $1 billion. It ties up significant capital, creating financial risk if the project underperforms. Expansion into unfamiliar markets always carries demand uncertainty and execution risk (cost overruns, delays, etc.). If market conditions change (e.g., steel demand drops or political instability arises), the expansion could become a financial liability.

Class: Geopolitical, Family: Government Business Policy, comment: Emerging Regulation, Naidu urged the company director to visit AP and have a first hand information about the facilities and natural resources available in the state to set up steel industry.

News: ArcelorMittal , the world 's largest steel maker , officially set foot in India for the second time and in a much bigger way . It closed a Rs 42,000 crore deal with the lenders of Essar Steel along with Nippon Steel on Monday . ArcelorMittal holds 60 per cent of AM/NS India ; the rest is with Nippon Steel . ArcelorMittal announced that Aditya Mittal , president and CFO of ArcelorMittal , had been appointed chairman of AM/NS India and Dilip Oommen , the CEO . Mittal 's appointment , however , did n't come as a surprise for industry players . He had played a key role in the acquisition of Essar and was even spotted during some of the court hearings . Oommen was the current managing director of Essar Steel . The Mittals and Nippon officials were expected to visit the plant at Hazira on Tuesday to take operational control . The closing of the transaction is a huge leg-up for the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code ( IBC ) even though it was achieved after 865 days with financial creditors realising more than 90 per cent of their admitted claims . The total admitted claims of financial creditors was Rs 49,473 crore of which State Bank of India ( SBI ) had the largest exposure at Rs 13,226 crore . SBI , chairman , Rajnish Kumar , said at an event in New Delhi , " One of the most important , observed and commented case ( Essar Steel ) has been resolved today . It will boost the bank 's profitability in the third quarter and will be a huge positive for the economy . " For the Hazira plant as much as for the Mittals , the resolution signals the start of a new chapter . Commenting , Lakshmi Mittal , chairman and CEO of ArcelorMittal , said , " The acquisition of Essar Steel is an important strategic step for ArcelorMittal . India has long been identified as an attractive market for our company and we have been looking at suitable opportunities to build a meaningful production presence in the country for over a decade . " " Both India and Essar 's appeal are enduring . Essar has a sizeable , profitable , well-located operations and the long-term growth potential for the Indian economy and therefore Indian steel demand are well known , " he added . Lakshmi Mittal also said that the combined strengths of Nippon would bring many new opportunities which would allow it to make a positive contribution to India 's target to grow steelmaking capacity to 300 million tonnes per annum by 2030 and for its manufacturing sector more broadly . The acquisition makes AM/NS India the fourth largest steel producer in India and the largest steel company in western India . Its current level of annualised crude steel production is 7.5 million tonnes . Additionally , it also has iron ore pellet facilities in the east of India , with a current annual capacity of 14 million tonnes per annum . Going forward , there are plans of ramping up capacity to 8.5 million tonnes over the medium-term ; the long-term aspiration is to increase finished steel shipments to between 12 and 15 million tonnes . The resolution plan for Essar had indicated a capital expenditure plan of Rs 18,697 crore to be implemented in two stages over six years . Aditya Mittal , President and CFO of ArcelorMittal , said , " This acquisition gives us the opportunity to contribute to India 's expansion in infrastructure and urbanization in the coming decades . " " To do this , we have in place a targeted capital expenditure plan designed to build on our combined management strength , operational expertise , commitment to safe , sustainable steelmaking and industry leading research and development , " he added . Eiji Hashimoto , Representative Director and President of Nippon Steel , said , Nippon Steel and ArcelorMittal would bring out AM/NS India 's potential by providing it with their respective business experience and world-leading advanced technologies , so as to promptly implement the resolution plan and realise its further business expansion .

With its completion , there are now about six resolutions from the RBI 's first list of non- performing assets ( NPAs ) with recoveries of 56.86 per cent of the admitted claims for financial creditors against an average of 42 per cent . Lakshmi Mittal said the transaction demonstrates how India benefits from the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code , a genuinely progressive reform whose positive impact would be felt widely across the Indian economy . SBI chairman Rajnish Kumar pointed out that the Essar case had settled almost every issue in the IBC process . There were several rounds of litigation in the case that tested many of the IBC clauses over the past two years . Kumar , however , said that there was still hesitation from both borrowers and lenders ' end to take early advantage of the IBC process . " An early resolution is a good way to preserve the economic value of the enterprise . It 's important to resolve early , " Kumar said . He further said that there should be no stigma attached to the bankruptcy process . " Nowhere in the world do we have this stigma . It 's a natural process that some businesses will survive and some will fail . It 's ultimately the survival of the fittest , " Kumar explained . However , Kumar felt that the IBC was not suitable for the resolution of micro , small and medium enterprises ( MSMEs ) . " It is more for the bigger corporates . MSMEs should have a rehabilitation . We are not in favour to take them to the NCLT because it will burden the system unnecessarily , " Kumar said .

News: A potential saviour for the Port Talbot steel plant has emerged in ThyssenKrupp , the German industrial conglomerate , as Tata Steel claimed it was committed to finding a buyer for its beleaguered UK business rather than closing the sites . The Observer understands that just three months ago ThyssenKrupp was in talks with Tata about buying Port Talbot and its other UK sites as part of a deal to buy its European business , including its other major steelworks in the Netherlands . However , the German company walked away due to concerns about the losses of the UK business and its pension liabilities of almost ? 15bn . A source close to Tata said " they could find a solution " and potentially rescue the deal with the Germans if the UK government provided substantial financial support and the pension scheme , which has 130,000 members , were restructured . However , the dire financial situation facing Tata 's UK steel business makes the prospect of any rescue deal difficult . It is understood that Tata Steel is losing ? 2.5m a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1m , and that it will lose at least ? 100m in running a sales process until the end of April . Tata is understood to have been close to announcing the closure of its UK business but decided to make a final attempt at finding a buyer and winning government support . " This is the last-chance saloon , " a source said . Reports in Europe on Friday claimed that ThyssenKrupp is interested in merging with Tata Steel 's European business after the sale of its UK arm , with the new business spun off as a joint venture . ThyssenKrupp has declined to comment on the reports . While this deal may eventually happen , ThyssenKrupp was initially in talks about the entire European business , a deal that would make it the largest steelmaker on the continent and stop any new competition emerging in the UK . The government is aware of its interest and is thought to have contacted the company . The suggestion that Tata could be willing to sell its Dutch plant alongside the UK business boosts hopes that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to growing pressure for a solution by announcing changes to official guidance to ensure that the public sector considers " the social and economic impact of the steel they source " for major projects -- meaning there will be an obligation to use UK-produced steel wherever possible . Labour will produce a four-point plan to rescue the industry , saying Tata must allow time for a buyer to be found and agreement to be reached , but that if no viable purchaser is available it should be nationalised . Shadow chancellor John McDonnell also wants to " fast track " key infrastructure projects requiring large amounts of steel . McDonnell said : " This plan is a good starting place for a framework by which hopefully we can get cross-party agreement to find a solution to save the industry and the workforce . " The UK steel industry and the government were thrown into crisis after Tata Steel announced it planned to pull out of the country , putting 15,000 jobs at risk at the company itself and a further 25,000 jobs in the supply chain . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sites , including Port Talbot , the biggest steelworks in the country . There are just weeks to find a buyer and the company will decide on the future of the UK business at a board meeting at the end of April . Sajid Javid , the business secretary , has urged Tata to act as a " responsible owner " and allow time to find a buyer . The government 's preferred option is thought to be to secure a deal by offering a loan to a new buyer . This loan would need to be on commercial terms so as not to fall foul of EU state-owned rules . The government will this week appoint a financial adviser to draw up the terms of any loan . Tata considers the options for its UK business to be a management buyout led by unions , a break-up to different buyers , a sale of the entire business to one party , potentially to ThyssenKrupp , or closure . However , all the options are fraught with difficulty . The unions would need financial backing for a deal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said : " There could be solutions for part of it , but that could be very messy . " The source insisted that the government and Tata were committed to finding a buyer , despite the dire financial situation and suggestions they were going through the motions . It is understood that if enough progress has been made in finding a buyer by the April board meeting , Tata will press ahead with talks rather than closing the UK sites . However , in India , Tata and its boss , Cyrus Mistry , are under pressure for holding on to the European business for so long . In a statement , Tata Steel said : " We are committed to running a meaningful process to explore strategic alternatives for Tata Steel 's UK business . This could include finding one or more buyers for our UK operations . The sale process began on Wednesday 30 March and although there is no fixed timeline , it needs to be implemented urgently as there are severe funding requirements affecting the UK business . " Tata 's pension liabilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steel Pension Scheme ( BSPS ) , which was inherited by Tata when it bought Corus in 2007 , has ? 14.5bn of liabilities , making it one of the biggest pension schemes in the UK .

The 130,000 members of the pension scheme , which has a deficit of ? 485m , face an uncertain future if Tata sells the business . John Ralfe , a pensions expert , said Tata Steel 's UK operations are a " pension fund with a business tagged on " . He warned that Tata could be forced to pay more than ? 2bn into the scheme if it sells the business . " Tata has n't addressed annual pension costs early enough . They should have closed to existing members a long time ago . They took the easy option . " They could have to pay more than ? 2bn to keep the regulator happy . " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enter the Protection Pension Fund . A new buyer of the business could therefore decide to buy it through an insolvency process , which would enable them to potentially offload the pension scheme .

If ThyssenKrupp purchases the UK business, it may be responsible for managing this pension liability.

### New News:

News: <h> Tata Steel close to reopening its top iron ore mine NEW DELHI : Tata Steel may be allowed to resume production from its biggest iron ore mine this month , a government official said , ending a stoppage of over three months that has forced the firm to import the raw material for the first time ever . India was earlier the third-largest supplier of iron ore in the world , but court restrictions over the past three years to curb illegal mining have prompted companies such as Tata Steel and JSW Steel to turn to imports . A restart of production at Tata Steel 's Noamundi mine should help India 's top steel company lower its reliance on overseas purchases of the steelmaking raw material .

Delays in renewing mining leases in Jharkhand and neighbouring Odisha have forced Tata Steel to resort to iron ore imports for the first time in its 107 years . It has bought 3 million tonnes of iron ore this fiscal year that began in March , mostly from overseas and from India 's top producer NMDC . Future imports will depend on the restart of Noamundi and other mines , spokesman Chanakya Chaudhary said . But transportation costs are a concern for the company . Unlike in countries like Japan , most steel plants in India are located in the resources heartland and away from the coasts .

Model-Generated Annotations:

Class: Governance, Family: Non-Compliance, Comment: Lease Renewal Delays, "The eastern state of Jharkhand, where Tata Steel started mining from the Noamundi mine in 1922, asked the company to stop operations in September pending a renewal of its lease." The delay in renewing the mining lease has halted operations at Tata Steel's Noamundi mine, forcing the company to import iron ore, which increases costs and affects operational efficiency.

Class: Financial, Family: Company Outlook, Comment: Increased Operational Costs, "Delays in renewing mining leases in Jharkhand and neighbouring Odisha have forced Tata Steel to resort to iron ore imports for the first time in its 107 years." The need to import iron ore due to halted domestic production increases operational costs and affects Tata Steel's financial performance.

Class: Geopolitical, Family: Government Business Policy, Comment: Regulatory Uncertainty, "India was earlier the third-largest supplier of iron ore in the world, but court restrictions over the past three years to curb illegal mining have prompted companies such as Tata Steel and JSW Steel to turn to imports." Regulatory changes and court restrictions on mining have created uncertainty, impacting Tata Steel's ability to secure raw materials domestically.

Class: Governance, Family: Process Risk, Comment: Supply Chain Disruption, "Future imports will depend on the restart of Noamundi and other mines, spokesman Chanakya Chaudhary said. But transportation costs are a concern for the company." The disruption in domestic iron ore supply has forced Tata Steel to rely on imports, which introduces supply chain risks and logistical challenges, particularly due to high transportation costs.

The state government , which was to renew 26 lapsed leases operating under a deemed extension is in the process of sending notices to mine owners including Tata Steel , Rungta , Aditya Birla company 's Essel Mining and KJS Ahluwalia and Stemcore 's Aryan Mining and trading Corporation asking why their lease applications should not be rejected . As per a Supreme Court order the state was to renew the leases or reject the long- pending applications before Novembre 15 . The move had mine owners rushing to New Delhi for crisis management . The development can further delay the resumption of iron ore mines in the state which accounted for almost half the country 's production last year .

Odisha 's move to only allow renewals to mine owners who had a downstream , sponge iron or steel plant , and to the extent of what the plant would consume over the next 30 years was stayed by the tribunal under the Mines Ministry and the High Court of Odisha . Adhunik Metaliks has even undergone a change of name to Orissa Manganese and Mineral Management , under which it owns a lease , to be compliant of this order .

News: <h> German leader seeks Indian support for Russia 's isolation German Chancellor Olaf Scholz sought assurances Saturday from India that it would support , or at least not block , Western efforts to isolate Russia for waging a devastating war against Ukraine NEW DELHI -- German Chancellor Olaf Scholz sought assurances Saturday from India that it would support , or at least not block , Western efforts to isolate Russia for waging a devastating war against Ukraine . Following his talks with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi , Scholz stressed that developing countries were being negatively impacted by energy and food shortages resulting from the war and hopes that India will help secure critical supplies to Asia , Africa and the Americas . Modi maintained his cautious approach and said India wanted the conflict to be ended through dialogue and diplomacy . " India is ready to make its contribution to any peace initiative , " he added . He has refrained from any overt criticism of Russia as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ India 's other economic needs . Scholz said that Russia 's war against Ukraine " violated the fundamental principle to what we all agree of not changing borders through the use of violence . " While the two leaders took no questions from the media after their meeting , Scholz later told German reporters that he and Modi had discussed the war in Ukraine " very extensively and very intensly , " but declined to elaborate , citing the confidential nature of the talks . Scholz , who arrived in the Indian capital on Saturday , also discussed with Modi ways to boost economic cooperation , including through a free trade agreement between the European Union and India . Scholz made clear he favors a free trade deal and said he " personally will make sure that ( the talks ) do not drag on . " The trip is Scholz 's first official visit to India , though it is his fourth meeting with Modi since taking office in 2021 , underlining Germany 's interest in reaching out to Delhi . " There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hydrogen , mobility , pharma and digital economy " with India , Scholz said in an interview published by The Times of India newspaper on Saturday . After a videoconference with fellow leaders from the Group of Seven industrial powers on Friday , Scholz said before leaving Berlin that " internationally , we are endeavoring to make clear that Russia stands alone in the world with its aggression against Ukraine . " Philipp Ackermann , the German ambassador to India , said he understands why India is buying large quantities of oil from Russia . " That 's something that the Indian government decides and as you get it at a very , very low price , you know I can not blame the Indian government for buying it , " New Delhi Television cited Ackermann as saying . Germany has been pushing to diversify its economic relations as it and other European countries try to avoid being dependent on China , a German official said on condition of anonymity because he was n't authorized to talk to reporters . Modi said the business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ digital technology , the telecommunication sector and diversification of supply chains . " We want to benefit from the Indian talent employed in Germany in the industrial sector , " he said . Speaking to reporters later Saturday , Scholz said Germany could help India achieve its ambitious goals when it comes to expanding renewable power generation . India is set to receive $10.5 billion in aid by 2030 to boost the use of clean energy under agreements the two sides signed in May last year . Scholz 's delegation included several German business leaders , including the head of ThyssenKrupp , which is trying to sell further submarines to India . Asked whether such a deal with India , which has been a major buyer of arms from Russia , could be struck , Scholz said he had " the impression that the quality of German technology enjoys great recognition and appreciate here . " The two-day visit will also take Scholz to India 's information technology hub Bengaluru on Sunday .

There is the possibility of diplomatic tension or challenges in navigating the political landscape, especially if India’s relationships with Russia are seen as conflicting with Germany’s stance.

### New News:

News: <h> UPA-2 : Time to change course May 21 , 2010 19:26 IST The government must give up its neo-liberal polices and obsession with GDP growth and shift its ideological centre of gravity leftwards , argues Praful Bidwai . It 's no aberration that the first anniversary of the return to power of the United Progressive Alliance should coincide with a tsunami of grassroots protests : From Orissa to Maharashtra , and from Tamil Nadu to Uttarakhand , through tribal Madhya Pradesh , Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand . The protests represent popular resistance to UPA-2 's industrialisation and mining policies and its zealous promotion of gross domestic product growth as an end in itself . Central here is the displacement and dispossession of vulnerable people . The government 's response to the protests has been to unleash repression by arresting their leaders and firing upon peaceful protesters . This is what happened last week in Orissa 's Jagatsinghpur district where large-scale demonstrations were organised against land acquisition for a giant steel plant of the South Korea-based company , Posco . The police imposed prohibitory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearby villages . Although Orissa has a non-UPA government , its approach towards the Posco project is similar to the UPA 's . Indeed , it 's even more ardent in pushing it than the Centre , which at least insists that Posco obtain proper environmental clearance . Lest it be thought that the Posco Pratirodh Sangram Samiti leaders are extremists , they belong to the Communist Party of India which has sustained the agitation for years . The Samiti has been on a dharna near Paradip port since January 26 . Recently , even the Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party joined or backed the protests . Last week , the police arrested CPI MP Bibhu Prasad Tarai and two Congress leaders ' as a preventive measure ' , opened fire , and injured more than 100 protesters . The Orissa police , never known for efficient law enforcement , have a record of brutality in dealing with movements which dare to oppose powerful interests . An example is the notorious firing at Kalinganagar in Jajpur district on January 2 , 2006 , in which 14 people were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost their limbs to the landmines planted by the police -- an indefensible use of a deadly weapon against the civilian population . On May 12 , the police again opened fire , killing one . As the Orissa events unfolded , Maharashtra 's Ratnagiri district saw a powerful march through several villages against another destructive UPA-promoted project -- a nuclear park , with six reactors , each of 1,600 MW , to be built at Jaitapur . Areva , the French company that is building them , is under interrogation on safety issues by the French nuclear regulatory agency . Areva 's design for the first reactor contracted in Western Europe after Chernobyl ( 1986 ) , at Olkiluoto in Finland , has fallen foul of Finnish , French and British regulators . The plant has been delayed by three- and-a-half years and is 60 percent over budget . Welding has been frozen since last October . If the project fails or is abandoned , it will sound the death-knell of the nuclear industry in the developed world . Yet , oblivious of all this -- and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promoting the Jaitapur project with memorable zeal . Although no contract has been drawn up , no project report prepared , and the site has n't received environmental clearance , the government is acquiring land under the emergency provisions of the colonial Land Acquisition Act of 1894 . The people oppose the project on grounds of safety and loss of land and livelihoods and have torn up the cheques they received ' in compensation ' . They do n't want to live in the vicinity of six big nuclear reactors , each larger than the Chernobyl plant , which will routinely emit radioactivity , and which could all undergo a catastrophic accident poisoning thousands of square miles . Unless the government rethinks its ill- conceived plan to build nuclear parks at coastal sites -- including Gujarat , Andhra Pradesh , Orissa , Tamil Nadu and West Bengal -- a nasty confrontation will assuredly occur . This raises issues of great gravity : Does local democracy , for which the UPA claims much credit , going back to Rajiv Gandhi 's 73rd and 74th Constitutional amendments , have any meaning ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a population that does n't feel secure or comfortable with it ? Should it persist with an energy technology that has proved costly and high-risk , and is declining the world over , when it has no agencies that can cope with emergencies , especially a deadly radioactivity crisis ? Similar questions are being posed by millions of people who oppose the gigantic loot of public resources called Special Economic Zones , petrochemicals investment regions , and projects in extractive industries like coal , bauxite , metallurgy and cement . No such project goes unopposed . The government and the promoters can not convince the people that their objections to livelihood destruction are irrational or unwarranted , that they will receive adequate compensation , and that alternative employment will materialise . Independent India 's experience with ' development ' projects has been dismal : Displacement of 45 million , the population of more than three-fourths of the world 's nations , with little rehabilitation . Even the Supreme Court has expressed concern at such violations of the right to life and asked that the Land Acquisition Act be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it says that land acquisition unrelated to public welfare is indefensible and causes trauma . ' It also creates hostility , mutual distrust and disharmony among the villagers , dividing them along the lines of " those who can influence and get their land deleted " and " those who can not " . Touts and middlemen flaunting political connections flourish , extracting money ... Why subject such a large number of citizens to such traumatic experience ? ' Underway in India today is a process of ' enclosure ' of land , similar to what happened in Western Europe three centuries ago , but much more compressed . This comes on top of a prolonged agrarian crisis , a 10-kg decrease in monthly per-capita foodgrain consumption over three decades , and the suicides of 200,000 farmers since 1997 -- historically unprecedented anywhere . Small-holder agriculture has become unviable in two-thirds of India . Farm incomes have n't kept pace with rising input costs . Agriculture has become more energy- , water- and capital-intensive and suffers from falling public investment , monoculture and high water use , rising imports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has also run up against major ecological barriers . Instead of addressing these issues , and promoting equitable growth and defending vulnerable livelihoods , the UPA is blindly pursuing neo-liberal approaches that have proved bankrupt the world over and are creating havoc domestically . Unless it quickly corrects course , the UPA will betray the promise of inclusive growth which was critical to its election victory in 2009 . Worse , it will get into a hostile confrontation with underprivileged people , undermine their subsistence , further distort growth processes and aggravate inequalities and disparities , thus sharpening social conflict . This is the surest recipe for breeding Naxalism where it does n't exist and exacerbating social divisions . Regrettably , not many UPA leaders are prepared to demand a policy review and correction along radical lines . Some Congress leaders like Mani Shankar Aiyar and Digvijay Singh , and sometimes Rahul Gandhi , express genuine concern about persistent destitution , rising income inequalities , and the state 's loss of popular credibility . Sonia Gandhi has decided to re-establish the National Advisory Council , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The National Rural Employment Guarantee Act too has had a positive impact . However , this is not nearly enough . The very content and the direction of the growth process has to change if it is not to remain predatory on the people . Some leaders refuse to go so radical . They are content to promote vigorous GDP growth regardless of its demands on human and natural resources , its origins in sleaze , criminality and dirty deals , and its inequality-enhancing nature . They believe faster growth will boost state revenues , which the government can target at worthy schemes like the NREGA to help the poor . This view is not as callous as the widely discredited ' trickle down ' approach . But it is badly flawed . It underestimates both the severity of the destruction wrought by neo-liberalism and the double injustice of further punishing and dispossessing people who live in wretched deprivation and are already at the bottom of the heap in this super-hierarchical society . It is not enough that the fruits of rapid growth are used to redress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself . Growth , or rather development , must become inherently inclusive , immanently equitable and based on people 's participation and consent . Sustainable development must be need-based , green and gender-just . It must not negate the worthy ethical imperative of defending the rights and interests of the poorest of the poor -- not even temporarily . The Congress must debate these issues . Or , it will drift into the same policy frame that eventually brought about the Bharatiya Janata Party 's election defeat . Regrettably , this decade is probably the first time that the Congress is in power without a left-of-centre pressure group or think tank within , like the Nehru Forum or the Young Turks , which is sorely needed . This is a void that far exceeds the government 's many political management errors , which have attracted all the media attention as UPA-2 completes its first year in power . The NAC could bring progressive inputs into policy-making if Sonia Gandhi broadens its membership and shifts its ideological centre of gravity leftwards .

Class: Geopolitical, Family: Political Violence, comment: Land Acquisition & Civil Unrest, Large- scale demonstrations were organised against land acquisition for a giant steel plant of the South Korea-based company, Posco. The police imposed prohibitory orders and arrested protest leaders. The protests represent popular resistance to UPA-2's industrialisation and mining policies and its zealous promotion of gross domestic product growth as an end in itself. Central here is the displacement and dispossession of vulnerable people. POSCO faces land acquisition challenges and political opposition. Grassroots protests and government crackdowns create risks of project delays, increased costs, reputational damage, or cancellation.

Class: Geopolitical, Family: Government Business Policy, comment: Regulatory Compliance & Environmental Clearance, Although Orissa has a non-UPA government, its approach towards the Posco project is similar to the UPA’s. Indeed, it’s even more ardent in pushing it than the Centre, which at least insists that Posco obtain proper environmental clearance. The requirement for environmental clearances, amid a politically charged and volatile regulatory environment, poses risks of non-compliance, legal delays, or project revocation for POSCO.

Class: Social, Family: Brand Perception, comment: Reputation and Human Rights & Ethical Issues, The Orissa police, never known for efficient law enforcement, have a record of brutality... the police arrested CPI MP Bibhu Prasad Tarai and two Congress leaders, opened fire, and injured more than 100 protesters. Heavy-handed responses by authorities, even if POSCO is not directly involved, could damage the company’s reputation internationally, especially among stakeholders sensitive to human rights and ESG performance.

Class: Governance, Family: Process Risks, comment: Operational Risk and Land Acquisition, Grassroots protests... raise issues of land acquisition unrelated to public welfare... causes trauma, hostility, mutual distrust and disharmony among villagers. Delays or cancellations in land acquisition processes disrupt the supply of critical resources (land) needed for industrial projects, posing risks to project feasibility and future capacity planning.

Class: Geopolitical, Family: Change in Government, comment: Ideological Shift & Policy Volatility, The government must give up its neo-liberal policies and obsession with GDP growth and shift its ideological centre of gravity leftwards.  A potential shift in government ideology or policy toward populism, environmental activism, or anti-globalization could lead to retroactive changes in permits, approvals, or policy frameworks affecting POSCO’s projects.

Class: Governance, Family: Litigation, comment: Lawsuit, Even the Supreme Court has expressed concern at such violations of the right to life and asked that the Land Acquisition Act be revised. Supreme Court involvement and legal challenges increase regulatory and reputational risks significantly.

Class: Geopolitical, Family: Government Business Policy, Comment: Regulatory and Political Risk, "This is what happened last week in Orissa's Jagatsinghpur district where large-scale demonstrations were organised against land acquisition for a giant steel plant of the South Korea-based company, Posco." The protests against land acquisition for Posco's steel plant in Orissa highlight the regulatory and political risks associated with obtaining necessary approvals and maintaining community relations, which could delay or halt project progress.

Class: Social, Family: Brand Perception, Comment: Public Image and Community Relations, "The protests represent popular resistance to UPA-2's industrialisation and mining policies and its zealous promotion of gross domestic product growth as an end in itself." The public protests against Posco's project could damage the company's reputation and strain its relationship with local communities, affecting its social license to operate.

Class: Governance, Family: Process Risk, Comment: Operational Delays and Legal Challenges, "The police arrested CPI MP Bibhu Prasad Tarai and two Congress leaders 'as a preventive measure', opened fire, and injured more than 100 protesters." The legal and operational challenges arising from the protests and subsequent police actions could lead to delays in project execution and potential legal battles, impacting Posco's operational timelines and costs.

News: London : Reports that Tata Steel is about to sell its long products division to Klesch Group are ' speculative ' and do not reflect the views of the company , the steelmaker told the National Stock Exchange ( NSE ) on Tuesday . Geneva-based Klesch Group , a global commodities business involved in chemicals , metals and oil production and trading , declined to comment .

News: ArcelorMittal , the world 's largest steel maker , officially set foot in India for the second time and in a much bigger way . It closed a Rs 42,000 crore deal with the lenders of Essar Steel along with Nippon Steel on Monday . ArcelorMittal holds 60 per cent of AM/NS India ; the rest is with Nippon Steel . ArcelorMittal announced that Aditya Mittal , president and CFO of ArcelorMittal , had been appointed chairman of AM/NS India and Dilip Oommen , the CEO . Mittal 's appointment , however , did n't come as a surprise for industry players . He had played a key role in the acquisition of Essar and was even spotted during some of the court hearings . Oommen was the current managing director of Essar Steel . The Mittals and Nippon officials were expected to visit the plant at Hazira on Tuesday to take operational control . The closing of the transaction is a huge leg-up for the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code ( IBC ) even though it was achieved after 865 days with financial creditors realising more than 90 per cent of their admitted claims . The total admitted claims of financial creditors was Rs 49,473 crore of which State Bank of India ( SBI ) had the largest exposure at Rs 13,226 crore . SBI , chairman , Rajnish Kumar , said at an event in New Delhi , " One of the most important , observed and commented case ( Essar Steel ) has been resolved today . It will boost the bank 's profitability in the third quarter and will be a huge positive for the economy . " For the Hazira plant as much as for the Mittals , the resolution signals the start of a new chapter . Commenting , Lakshmi Mittal , chairman and CEO of ArcelorMittal , said , " The acquisition of Essar Steel is an important strategic step for ArcelorMittal . India has long been identified as an attractive market for our company and we have been looking at suitable opportunities to build a meaningful production presence in the country for over a decade . " " Both India and Essar 's appeal are enduring . Essar has a sizeable , profitable , well-located operations and the long-term growth potential for the Indian economy and therefore Indian steel demand are well known , " he added . Lakshmi Mittal also said that the combined strengths of Nippon would bring many new opportunities which would allow it to make a positive contribution to India 's target to grow steelmaking capacity to 300 million tonnes per annum by 2030 and for its manufacturing sector more broadly . The acquisition makes AM/NS India the fourth largest steel producer in India and the largest steel company in western India . Its current level of annualised crude steel production is 7.5 million tonnes . Additionally , it also has iron ore pellet facilities in the east of India , with a current annual capacity of 14 million tonnes per annum . Going forward , there are plans of ramping up capacity to 8.5 million tonnes over the medium-term ; the long-term aspiration is to increase finished steel shipments to between 12 and 15 million tonnes . The resolution plan for Essar had indicated a capital expenditure plan of Rs 18,697 crore to be implemented in two stages over six years . Aditya Mittal , President and CFO of ArcelorMittal , said , " This acquisition gives us the opportunity to contribute to India 's expansion in infrastructure and urbanization in the coming decades . " " To do this , we have in place a targeted capital expenditure plan designed to build on our combined management strength , operational expertise , commitment to safe , sustainable steelmaking and industry leading research and development , " he added . Eiji Hashimoto , Representative Director and President of Nippon Steel , said , Nippon Steel and ArcelorMittal would bring out AM/NS India 's potential by providing it with their respective business experience and world-leading advanced technologies , so as to promptly implement the resolution plan and realise its further business expansion . Aug 2 , 2017 Essar Steel admitted to NCLT Feb 12 , 2018 ArcelorMittal , Numetal submit bids for Essar Steel Oct 4 , 2018 Supreme Court grants ArcelorMittal and Numetal time to clear dues for NPAs to be eligible to bid for Essar Steel November 15 , 2019 Supreme Court sets aside the NCLAT order paving way for the deal Big boost for IBC Essar was one of the 12 big-ticket cases mandated for resolution by the Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) under the IBC . With its completion , there are now about six resolutions from the RBI 's first list of non-performing assets ( NPAs ) with recoveries of 56.86 per cent of the admitted claims for financial creditors against an average of 42 per cent . Lakshmi Mittal said the transaction demonstrates how India benefits from the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code , a genuinely progressive reform whose positive impact would be felt widely across the Indian economy . SBI chairman Rajnish Kumar pointed out that the Essar case had settled almost every issue in the IBC process . There were several rounds of litigation in the case that tested many of the IBC clauses over the past two years . Kumar , however , said that there was still hesitation from both borrowers and lenders ' end to take early advantage of the IBC process . " An early resolution is a good way to preserve the economic value of the enterprise . It 's important to resolve early , " Kumar said . He further said that there should be no stigma attached to the bankruptcy process . " Nowhere in the world do we have this stigma . It 's a natural process that some businesses will survive and some will fail . It 's ultimately the survival of the fittest , " Kumar explained . However , Kumar felt that the IBC was not suitable for the resolution of micro , small and medium enterprises ( MSMEs ) . " It is more for the bigger corporates . MSMEs should have a rehabilitation . We are not in favour to take them to the NCLT because it will burden the system unnecessarily , " Kumar said .

News: <h> The deal that hamstrung Tata Steel Between 2000 and 2010 , Ratan Tata embarked on a near-$20bn acquisition spree , transforming his family 's business into one of world 's top conglomerates . The Indian tycoon scooped up Tetley Tea and Jaguar Land Rover in the UK , New York 's Pierre Hotel and South Korean truck maker Daewoo . However , the industrialist 's most ambitious acquisition came on January 31 , 2007 , when Tata Steel finally triumphed over Brazilian rival Cia . Siderurgica Nacional ( CSN ) in a bidding war for Corus , the FTSE 100 steelmaker forged from the 1999 merger of British Steel with Dutch rival Hoogovens . But despite the victory , the Indian firm 's shares dropped almost 11pc . Tata Steel 's winning bid valued Corus -- the owner of the Port Talbot steelworks -- at ? 6.2bn , much higher than the Indian firm 's ? 4.1bn initial approach . The battle with CSN had forced Tata Steel to ramp-up its bid and investors were now worried about the price and debt the Indian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tata , whose great grandfather founded parent company Tata , was confident in his gamble on British steel . " Quite frankly I do feel the stock market is both taking a short-term and harsh view , " he declared defiantly . " In future , somebody will look back and say we did the right thing . " Almost a decade later , however , and Tata Steel has finally conceded it got it wrong . On Wednesday , just hours after the company revealed it was putting its UK steel assets up for sale , Koushik Chatterjee , Tata Steel 's finance director , admitted the British businesses now had a book value of " almost zero " . The UK division 's fate was decided at a marathon seven-hour meeting on Tuesday evening in Mumbai , when Tata 's board -- led by chairman Cyrus Mistry , who succeeded Ratan Tata in 2012 -- rejected a turnaround plan for the assets that once made up British Steel . As many as 40,000 jobs are under threat if a buyer for all or parts of Tata @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biggest steel plant in Port Talbot -- is not found . David Cameron , the Prime Minister , has warned there is " no guarantee " the Government can save Tata 's sites and cautioned he does n't believe nationalisation " is the right answer " . The closure of Tata 's operations would sound the death knell for what remains of Britain 's steel industry . Given the state of Tata Steel UK 's finances , it is a wonder the Indian conglomerate kept the operations running for as long as it did . The UK steel business is losing over ? 1m a day and since 2010 Tata has taken ? 2bn in impairments on the division . Annual pre-tax losses at Tata Steel UK more than doubled to ? 768m in the 12 months to the end of March last year , despite the business generating revenues of about ? 4.2bn . However , those sales were down 7pc on 2014 and were wiped out last year by nearly ? 4.5bn in operating costs , of which raw materials and consumables accounted for almost half . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scheme could also prove an obstacle to any rescue . The scheme has approximately 130,000 members and liabilities approaching ? 15bn , although the deficit was reduced to ? 485m last year . Tata could still be forced to make a contribution , or the Government could step in . The exit from the UK would mean Tata Steel 's Dutch assets will be its only European business , and there were suggestions on Friday it could combine the operation with those of Germany 's ThyssenKrupp . Whatever the fate of Tata 's Dutch division , however , the end of its British steel interests appears unavoidable , marking the end of a disastrous era for the Indian giant . In many respects , its exit has been partly caused by the debt Tata Steel assumed when it first entered Britain with the Corus deal . Nine years ago , the takeover of Corus catapulted Tata onto the world stage . At the time Ratan Tata hailed the move " as the first big step that the Indian industry has taken in the international marketplace ... as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ? 6.2bn deal signalled investor unease . Tata contributed $4.1bn to fund the takeover , raised a further $6.1bn in debt and used a bridge loan . A host of factors have since conspired against British steelmakers and their rivals in Europe . Steel prices have collapsed as cheap imports from unprofitable Chinese producers have flooded into Europe and the UK . A record 112m tonnes of steel were exported from China last year and the steel industry has accused Beijing of " dumping " it in the EU . " There 's a perfect storm across Europe that we 've been at the centre of in the UK , " says Dominic King , the head of policy at UK Steel . However , exacerbating the situation in the UK has been the Government 's stance towards steelmaking . Business rates on heavy industry in the UK are much higher than elsewhere in Europe ; steelmakers pay far more for electricity than rivals in Europe ; and the British Government has been accused of impeding EU measures to combat Chinese dumping . Tata Steel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the UK business . Since the Corus deal , it is understood the firm has invested ? 1.5bn in new plant and technology , and spent a further ? 2bn on raw materials and other investments . However , Tata Steel 's ability to weather the storm in the steel industry has been weakened by its borrowings , which totalled $11bn in net debts as of the end of last year and have put huge pressure on its balance sheet . At the same time , the steel crisis in the UK has only deepened . SSI decided to close the Redcar steelworks last October , and just days later Caparo Industries collapsed . So it is surprising ministers have been caught off-guard by the turn of events at Tata , which had been regularly updating the Government its situation . On Tuesday , Sajid Javid , Britain 's business secretary , was arriving in Australia for a trade mission during Tata 's board meeting to decide the future of the UK steel division . The Prime Minister was at the tail-end of a family holiday in Lanzarote . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British steel 's woes , but analysts believe it will be hard to find a buyer for every part of Tata Steel , particularly Port Talbot , with its expensive-to-run furnaces . Private equity firm Greybull is still to complete its deal to buy Tata 's Scunthorpe steelworks , a purchase that is expected within days , and so is not thought to be in the running to rescue further sites . An offer from a Chinese firm is also considered unlikely . However , just as Ratan Tata shook up British steelmaking in 2007 , a solution to the industry 's current crisis may be found in another Indian businessman . Sanjeev Gupta , founder of commodities firm Liberty House , is interested not just in buying some of Tata 's steel processing assets , but in working with ministers and Tata to find a future for Port Talbot . He has pitched to the Government the idea of replacing the plant 's blast furnaces with electric arc furnaces , which use recycled scrap to make steel . " There would be a lot of work needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he is clearly passionate about helping to find a solution to the industry 's current woes . " I do n't want to see the end of steelmaking in the UK. "

News: <h> Russia - ESG Update Although the production of fossil fuels has played a significant role in the Russian energy sector , Russia does not stand aside from global trends in the area of energy transition , development of renewable energy sources and GHG emissions reductions . As a result , **31;102;TOOLONG ( ESG ) triad is becoming an increasingly topical issue in Russia . The pace of development in this sector is phenomenal . In recent months only , a considerable number of events have occurred that form the basis of ESG in Russia . For you to be always up to date with the current trends , the Moscow Office of Herbert Smith Freehills has launched regular publications of ESG Updates . This update is a summary of the most essential regulatory/policy changes and market developments in the field of ESG in Russia . Our firm has been advising on ESG issues for over 30 years and is deeply involved in this topic . Among other things , Herbert Smith Freehills maintains the ESG Hub to post ESG materials drawn up by our offices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initial version of the Draft Law , which we covered earlier in one of our publications , the new one allows holding the experiment not only in the Sakhalin region but also in others . The experiment expansion in terms of territory is expected to require amendments to the federal law to be adopted pursuant to the Draft Law . In addition to the Sakhalin region , there are at least four Russian regions interested in participating in the experimenti . To recap , the Federal Law " On Limiting GHG Emissions " ( the GHG Law ) took effect in December 2021 . Among other things , it introduced carbon reporting and established a legal framework for the trading of carbon units ( the units verify the implementation of voluntary climate projects to reduce carbon footprint ) . According to the draftsman , the GHG Law sets an example of " soft " regulation , while the Draft Law provides for tougher measures . They refer to setting up the GHG emissions quota system . Emitters will be charged a fee if the quota is exceeded and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than quoted . The fee will be established by the Russian Government . According to public sourcesii , it will be calculated with reference to the average global price of emissions and the average quota price in the EU ETS . The fee is expected to be remitted to the relevant regional budget and spent on activities for reduction of GHG emissions and increase of their absorption , as well as related R&amp;D efforts . Credits may be traded freely alongside the carbon units covered by the GHG Law . The amount of the quotas will be approved on a regional level , taking into account public debate . Some representatives of the business community have reacted to the introduction of the quota system negatively , insist on abandoning it and propose not to expand the experiment to the other territories , until the Sakhalin experiment demonstrates unbiased positive outcomes . Among other things , enterprises operating in certain sectors ( e.g. gas infrastructure development , low carbon hydrogen production ) are proposed to be excluded from the experiment . The business also asks for tax benefits to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian Ministry of Economic Development commented on the remarks of the business by stating that introducing quotas on emissions and charging a fee for exceeding the quotas are the key elements of the experimentiii . The introduction of quotas is particularly important in the context of the carbon border tax expected to be introduced in the EU ( the CBAM ) . The creation of a national emissions quota system may potentially allow to decrease the CBAM burden for Russian exporters . CBAM adverse effect may turn out to be quite far-reaching for Russian companies . Thus , according to the chairman of the board of directors of a major Russian iron and steel producer , PJSC Severstal , the annual damage to the company will amount to approximately USD 70 million per yeariv , and , as estimated by the first deputy prime minister of the Russian Government , the ?

Cooperation with these countries , in the first place , is primarily accounted for by their interest in Sakhalin projects . The representative of the Russian Ministry of Economic Development clarified that , in addition to Japan and Singapore , negotiations at the EAEU level are expected to be heldvi . Incentives for investment in reducing carbon dioxide emissions Experts of the Centre for Strategic Research1 ( the CSR ) have elaborated a set of exemptions and benefits for the business . According to CSR experts , to boost investment in reducing carbon dioxide emissions it is necessary to introduce an investment tax deduction or depreciation allowance on the profits tax for the integration of low and zero carbon technologies , as well as for the use of secondary energy resources ( SER ) in the production of goods . In addition to motivation for the business , incentive measures for individuals are proposed to be taken . For example , the introduction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other forms of targeted financial supportvii . Carbon dioxide capture and sequestration projects Russian companies consider investment in carbon dioxide capture and storage ( CCS ) projects . The ? ? S basically is a process of flooding carbon dioxide into an underground tank or subsurface which prevent its discharge to the surface . Such technology is already used for climate purposes abroad , specifically , in the US . In December 2021 , Gazprom neft was reported to have announced its plans to invest RUB 30 billion in the CCS project in the Orenburg region . At the first stage , the amount of about 1 Mtpa CO2 is expected to be pumpedviii . NOVATEK and Tatneft had also made public announcements on the proposed implementation of similar projects earlierix . Currently , there are neither ongoing CCS projects nor relevant regulations in Russia . The implementation of such projects involves significant costs , which may necessitate governmental support measures . HYDROGEN Low carbon hydrogen energy program According to public sources , the Russian Ministry of Energy has drawn up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be potentially extended up to 2050 . The document has not been made public yet . The program explores four cases for the development of both " blue " and " green " hydrogen production and exports . Pursuant to the base case , hydrogen exports will amount to about 12 Mtpa by 2050 . The amount of proposed investment in the program is expected to be USD 26 billion , of which USD 9 billion constitute the national support funds for the creation of the logistics infrastructure . The Russian Ministry of Energy mentions ten most crucial hydrogen export pilot projects , including the projects of such companies , as NOVATEK and Rosatom . The program indicates risks which may affect the achievement of targeted outcomes , such as the fall in prices caused by large-scale projects in Saudi Arabiax .

Ammonia will be transformed into hydrogen by the purchaser , as the transportation of pure hydrogen is expensive and dangerous . German-based RWE and Japan-based Mitsui may become other potential purchasers of NOVATEKxi . In the very end of November 2021 , the Russian president instructed the Russian Government and Gazprom to explore the possibility of exporting hydrogen to Europe in the form of methane-hydrogen mixture via the existing pipelinesxii . Previously , the production of hydrogen at the location of its consumption had been viewed as preferable . There is a view that Nord Stream 2 might be used for hydrogen transportationxiii . In mid-December 2021 , the European Commission prepared a number of legislative proposals to ensure energy safety of the European Union and gas market decarbonisation , including in respect of the hydrogen market regulation . One of the main aims is to establish a market for hydrogen , create the right environment for investment , and enable the development of dedicated infrastructure , including for trade with third countries . The market rules will cover such issues as access to hydrogen infrastructures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tariff settingxiv . The low carbon gas market will be potentially regulated by the same rules as the gas market , i.e. pursuant to the EU Third Energy Package . Hydrogen and metallurgy Global steel company NLMK Group andRusatom Overseas ( part of Rosatom group ) signed an agreement on cooperation in hydrogen production and development of CCS technologies . Among other things , the agreement provides for joint research in hydrogen technologies , as well as the implementation of pilot projects . NLMK treats the use of low carbon hydrogen as one of prospective areas of the metals industry developmentxv . Hydrogen and nuclear power The first Russian nuclear power plant which energy is expected to be used for hydrogen production may start operating in Russia as early as in 2036 . This is a project of Rosatom group . The development of the conceptual design of a high-temperature gas-cooled reactor ( HTGCR ) is being currently completed , and the engineering design of the HTGCR unit is scheduled to be finalised by 2023xvi . Most likely , it is the pilot project based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Exchange registered the first issue of transition bonds On 17 December 2021 , the Moscow Exchange for the first time registered a bond loan compliant with the transition bondsprinciples and adaptation financial instrumentcriteria . The issuer of such bonds is INK-Capital . Cash proceeds from the issue of transition bonds are expected to be used for refinancing of the project aimed at the disposal of APG that used to be flaredxviii . On 14 December 2021 , a meeting of the Public Council of the Russian Ministry of Energy was held to discuss the issue of RES development in Russia . At the meeting , the minister of energy proposed discontinuing additional RES support after 2035 once the prices for RES and traditional generation become equal . It is anticipated that in such case this support will be unnecessary . By that time , investors are expected to be able to build green plants on their ownxix . ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION Law on the elimination of accumulated harm to the environment The bill we had dealt with in detail in the previous overview became a law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except for certain provisions . Trend of tightening the environmental policy On 14 December 2021 , the Russian Government held a meeting to consider a number of significant items on the Russian environmental agenda . In particular , the issues of implementing the Clean Air federal project were brought up . To recap , its implementation entails , among other things , the reduction -- by at least 20% -- of the aggregate emissions of pollutants into the atmosphere in the most contaminated cities by the end of 2024 . Pursuant to the Federal Law " On Holding the Experiment of Quoting Emissions of Pollutants " adopted in furtherance of the federal project , emission limits ( which take into account the emission targets ) shall be set for the sources of air pollutants in the cities where the experiment is conducted . Where such quotas can not be complied with , enterprises shall elaborate and carry out the relevant activities to reduce emissions . It was noted at the meeting that industrial enterprises are reluctant to perform their experiment-related duties . Instructions were issued to extend the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a failure to meet the quotas are proposed to be introduced . Among other things , the problematic issues of implementing the transition of enterprises to the best available techniques ( BATs ) were discussed . The reform is intended to improve environmental friendliness of production facilities through the integration of best practices reflected in BAT reference books . The transition to BATs is encouraged , while the refusal to use them is , on the contrary , subject to certain sanctions ( such as the need to pay increased environmental fees ) . However , the existing BATs were repeatedly criticised for being too soft , inefficient and significantly lagging behind not only EU standards but even standards that used to be in place in Russia before . Thus , during the meeting the deputy prime minister asked the Russian president to bring the rules of the BAT technology reference book " Fuel combustion at major units for energy generation purposes " into compliance with the 1995 state standard . As a result of the meeting , the Russian president agreed to notably strengthen liability of company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ updating the BAT reference book on fuel combustionxx . Liability for breaching the requirements for the prevention of oil product spills A law imposing liability for breaching the requirements for the prevention and elimination of oil and oil product spills was adopted . The law envisages fines of up to RUB 500,000 , and a repeated breach may threaten companies with the suspension of their activities for up to three months . The new regulation will take effect from 2022 . The requirements for the prevention and elimination of oil and oil product spills have been introduced in response to the large-scale oil spill through the fault of Norilsk Nickel . The company was ordered by the court to reimburse RUB 146 bln ( app . USD 2 bln ) in damages .

News: <h> Russian business is turning to new markets -- Europe must do the same The pattern of onshoring , nearshoring and import substitution established during the pandemic accelerated dramatically after Russia sent troops into Ukraine . Six EU sanctions packages followed , and over 200 foreign companies exited the Russian market . But the EU is not the only destination for Russian goods and services . The Global South accounts for 80% of the world 's population and just over half of global GDP . Russia is an established player there , and Russian companies have proved quick on the draw in re-directing their Europe-bound trade to the South . Alexey Miller , CEO of state-owned gas giant Gazprom , told executives and politicians at the St Petersburg International Economic Forum ( SPIEF ) that the company had increased its gas exports to China by almost 70% in the first five months of 2022 when compared with the same period the previous year . China has accounted for 32% of the growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to RIA Novosti , so is a key strategic market for gas providers . With Chinese gas demand growing by an average 22bn cubic metres a year for the past five years , Russia 's pivot to China is only set to accelerate . Meanwhile , China and India have overtaken Germany as the biggest buyers of Russian crude oil . Russia exported a record 8.42mn tonnes of discounted crude oil to China in May -- almost 2mn barrels per day ( bpd ) , which is an increase of 28% relative to April . Russia said last month it expects up to RUB1 trillion ( $14.4bn ) in additional oil and gas revenues in 2022 . India and China between them are purchasing enough Russian oil to compensate for the loss in western custom . The phenomenon is not limited to energy giants . Russian companies across the board have been redirecting trade flows in response to dwindling import demand in Europe . China is one of the most significant new markets for Russian business . Russian trade with its southeastern neighbour grew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , according to data published by Chinese customs . China and Russia hope to grow that figure further -- to a whopping $200bn per year by the end of 2024 . Russia 's metallurgical companies turned to China after Europe banned imports of Russian steel slab . Fastmarkets reports that Russia exported 1.3mn tonnes of steel slab to European countries in 2020 . With this market gone , steel companies Severstal , NLMK and Evraz re-directed exports to emerging markets . The 400,000 tonnes of semi-finished steel products sent to China by the three companies in the second half of April exceeded the amount exported to China in the whole of 2021 by more than five times . By selling their products at a significant discount relative to the other regional steel producers ( such as Malaysia and Indonesia ) , the Russian companies hope to establish a foothold in the Chinese market and cultivate relationships with new clients . Petrochemicals manufacturer Sibur provides another striking example . More than 20% of Sibur 's products used to be exported to Europe , which was the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went primarily to Eastern Europe , France , Germany and the Netherlands . Now , the share of Sibur 's sales going to Russia 's western neighbours has been reduced almost to zero , while its Asian exports have ballooned . Forced to re-shape its trade flows , the company now plans to increase exports to Asia significantly this year . The company will most likely return to the market if sanctions are lifted , but for now some European companies will not be receiving products from Sibur . Meanwhile , European imports of synthetic rubber and polymers from Russia have dropped steeply , as have some of the components needed to manufacture them such as naphtha and LPG . Analysts are predicting shortages of both goods unless European companies can find new suppliers to make up the shortfall , but specialist materials like these can be notoriously difficult to source at short notice . Sibur 's case is a particularly effective litmus test because the company has not been sanctioned . It is therefore a useful indication of the general flow of Russian goods away from Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ahead of the curve here , as it has been working with China for more than 10 years , allowing it to adapt more quickly than other Russian companies . The Chinese direction was set by former CEO Dmitry Konov , who left the company this year amid Western sanctions against Russian officials and businessmen . Educated in Switzerland , Konov has a reputation for striking up foreign partnerships and championing an outward-looking management style . His strategy of increasing resilience by orientating trade flows towards developing markets has proved very perceptive . If Sibur is indeed an early indicator , and other Russian companies follow its pivot to the Global South , the implications for world trade could be significant . Speaking at a business forum of leaders from BRICS countries in June ( Brazil , Russia , India , China and South Africa ) , Russian President Vladimir Putin said that " Russian business circles are activating their contacts with the business communities of the BRICS countries ... The volumes of Russian oil delivered to China and India are growing noticeably . Collaboration in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significant volumes of fertilisers to BRICS states . Russian IT companies are expanding their activities in India and South Africa ... " As Russian producers forge new trading partnerships and strengthen existing ones , business confidence in June reached its highest level since February . Activity in Russia 's manufacturing sector also began expanding again last month . Where next ? There can be no question that European sanctions are contributing to adverse effects on the Russian economy , and a deep recession is on the way . Russia 's Ministry of Economic Development estimated that growth was down 4.3% in May 2022 . And transactions through the Central Bank of Russia 's payments system were down 7.2% in June compared with the previous quarter -- a reliable sign of economic decline . But it is also clear that Russian companies are flexible enough to look for new trading partners , and that many of them have long been geared up to do just that . On the other hand , European industry is looking increasingly anaemic without the supplies of Russian raw materials which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world 's largest importer of natural gas , and some very industrialised countries such as Germany rely heavily on Russian commodities for their export-based economic model . With benchmark European gas prices around five times higher than they were a year ago , Europe is reeling . The shock has contributed to a steady devaluation of the euro , which is now at its weakest level in twenty years . WTO forecasts for merchandise trade volumes in 2022-3 show " Europe is now expected to underperform on the import side " . The continent is set to experience shortages of some of the raw materials and consumables provided chiefly by Russia , including grain , energy and rare metals like palladium . European companies must now show that they are as resilient as their Russian counterparts , which are forging new partnerships and entering new markets . Africa could be an invaluable partner in this undertaking . Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi has signed a new gas supply deal with Algeria to increase gas imports by around 40% . And British energy giant BP is looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gap created when it left the Russian gas market . West African LNG supplier Nigeria LNG is looking to boost gas production from the end of the year in order to help meet increased demand from the likes of France and Portugal . The Middle East will be another important player in the bid to wean Europe off Russian commodities . US President Joe Biden recently returned from a visit to the region , ostensibly hoping to improve trading relations with Saudi Arabia as well as to promote the US ' geopolitical objectives . In an article for the Washington Post , Biden wrote that he was going to the Middle East because the region 's " energy resources are vital for mitigating the impact on global supplies of Russia 's war in Ukraine . " Biden added that Saudi officials are " working with my experts to help stabilise oil markets with other OPEC producers . " Qatar , which currently supplies around 30% of its gas to the European Union , has so far been the only Gulf state to indicate that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover the shortfall . But much more can be done . Israel alone could provide Europe with 10% of the gas currently coming from Russia . The Middle East 's steel market , meanwhile , can churn out about 16 times the annual volume formerly supplied to the EU by Russia . Russian industry has shown that the decline in trade relations between Russia and Europe need not be a death knell . European companies must demonstrate the same versatility if the West is to successfully re-orientate its model of trade .

News: <h> RAEX-Europe : First ESG ranking of Russian iron and steel companies The first ESG ranking of Russian iron and steel companies showcases fairly high results in terms of the quality of corporate governance , while the average scores for social and environmental factors are noticeably lower . This is especially relevant for such factors as climate change adaptation and co-operation with suppliers . Key ESG risk for Russian iron and steel industry The global climate agenda is becoming more acute and the climate goals are becoming more ambitious . Industrial and financial companies around the globe have announced their plans to become carbon neutral . Investors , represented by pension funds , large insurance companies and portfolio managers are tightening their approaches regarding the selection of investment targets . Additional incentives are also being created at the level of governments and associations . Amongst the latter , the mechanism for cross-border carbon regulation , proposed by the EU , has triggered an especially active discussion . Essentially , being a tax on imported products based on their carbon intensity , the mechanism is designed to prevent the so-called " carbon leakage " and to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is exactly the sort of cross-border carbon regulation that is going to become the main " transit " climate risk for Russian iron and steel companies , whose products are in high demand in Europe . According to various estimates , the amount of carbon tax for Russian manufacturers of semi-finished , rolled and finished products could reach ? 250-450mn annually . This will most likely be an additional reason for Russian metallurgists to start paying special attention to both low-carbon development projects and environmental , social and governance ( ESG ) risks in general . ESG Ranking of RAEX-Europe We released our first ESG ranking of the largest Russian companies back in 2018 . In the ranking , we assess the relevant ESG risks for companies and the mitigation of respective risks . Over the past year , our methodology for the assessment of companies has changed significantly : the number of analysed indicators has risen to more than 200 ( see Box 1 ) , and we have begun to take controversial situations and incidents ( controversies ) into consideration . Besides , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the verification of preliminary results in order to improve the quality of the assigned ratings . The expansion of the analytical base and the increase in the number of companies in the ranking allowed us to analyse the industry specifics in more detail as well as to start issuing industry rankings . The ranking of iron and steel companies presented in this article is the result of the analysis of ten largest Russian companies of the industry by revenue in 2019 ( see Box 2 ) . We have updated our ranking on a monthly basis , so it reflects occasional changes in the policies and procedures of the assessed companies , as well as the results of controversies monitoring . The plan is to expand the ranking further , as well as to update it , as the companies release their non-financial reports for 2020 . NLMK became the leader of our ranking ( see Table 1 ) , and made it into the top ten of our integrated ESG ranking of Russian companies , taking 4th place in the social category . NLMK demonstrates a high level of non- financial information disclosure in all the three areas of ESG . Moreover , the company has managed to significantly reduce specific and absolute figures of energy and water consumption in recent years . NLMK has also succeeded in meeting its ambitious workplace injuries targets : the company 's LTIFR has declined by 56% since 2013 . Also worth mentioning is the composition of NLMK 's board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the directors are independent . The reporting of Severstal , which is ranked second , also demonstrates a high level of transparency . The company pays significant attention to reducing environmental pollution and corporate social responsibility issues . Furthermore , Severstal received the highest industry score in the " Human Capital " category , which is based on the assessment of labour practices , occupational health and safety , recruitment practices and inclusivity . The Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works ( MMK ) rounds out the top three : the company has earned a high assessment of its business ethics practices and structure of the BoD . Sector specifics Due to the fact that the majority of the companies analysed are industry leaders , the distribution of companies by rating class is skewed towards higher scores . NLMK and Severstal are in the rating class , three companies are in the BBB class , two in the BB class , one company in the B , CCC and C classes ( medium and low ratings ) ( see Chart 1 ) . The companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ score for corporate governance practices ( 63 points out of 100 ) . However , the average score for the environmental performance of iron and steel companies ( 36 points ) is 2 points lower than that for oil and gas companies , whose updated ESG rating was published in January this year . At the same time , the average score for the social performance of iron and steel companies ( 49 points ) is 7 points higher than that of oil &amp; gas companies . Distribution of iron and steel companies by ESG rating The most problematic ESG factors with the lowest average scores include co-operation with suppliers on environmental and social issues , adaptation to climate change and renewable energy . If we talk about individual quantitative indicators , the intra-industry comparison is hampered , first of all , by the different level of disclosure of non-financial information in the sample . For example , a high-quality time series for workplace injuries can be extracted from the reports of only five companies ( NLMK , Severstal , Evraz , Metalloinvest and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down by about 20% from 2015 to 2019 . However , this figure is still 30% above the global industry average ( calculated by the World Steel Association based on the data from 104 steel companies ) ( see Chart 2 ) . Dynamics of the average LTIFR for the sample of Russian iron and steel companies and for the global sample of the World Steel Association Secondly , the comparison is made more difficult due to the differences of the companies in the sample , largely related to the presence or absence of a mining division . Nevertheless , based on the data of five companies from our sample , we observe positive industry dynamics for specific air emissions ( see Chart 3 ) and direct greenhouse gas ( GHG ) emissions ( Scope 1 , see Chart 4 ) . It is important to note that the level of disclosure of indirect GHG emissions ( Scope 2 ) among Russian iron and steel companies remains extremely low . We anticipate that in the future Russian iron and steel companies will improve the transparency of their non-financial indicators and as such will reduce the negative impact of their operations on the environment . The industry has significant decarburisation potential . Decisive and timely steps in this direction can reduce transit risks associated with European regulation and become a competitive advantage for the industry . Box 1 . Methodology reference : A company 's position in the Ranking is based on the score ( from 0 to 100 ) obtained as a part of the ESG rating assignment . Companies are ranked from those with the highest score ( " leaders " ) to those with the lowest score ( " outsiders " ) . The final score is a weighted average of the three components - E , S , and G sections . Each section includes two to four blocks , with weights set according to the industry . Figure 5 depicts the block weights for the iron and steel industry . In turn , each block consists of several thematic factors , in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company ( for example , a policy to reduce climate risks ) , reporting ( for example , the presence of annual CO2 emissions disclosure ) , as well as the company 's performance . In total , the current methodology uses over 200 quantitative and qualitative indicators and provides companies with an opportunity to comment on the preliminary results of the assessment and to send us additional information for the assessment . The full version of the methodology is available on the RAEX-Europe website . RAEX-Europe ( Rating- Agentur Expert RA GmbH ) is an independent European rating agency based in Frankfurt , officially registered by ESMA ( European Securities and Markets Authority ) with an ECAI ( External Credit Assessment Institution ) status . The Agency assigns classic credit ratings according to the international scale as well as non-credit ESG ratings .

### New News:

News: With an abundance of sun and wind , Spain is positioning itself as Europe 's future leader in green hydrogen production to clean up heavy industries . But some energy sector experts express caution over ramping up an industry that would be wholly reliant on massive increases in the availability of zero-carbon electricity . Ecological transition minister Teresa Ribera hosted a major conference earlier this month for global renewable energy players . It focused on measures " to guarantee our energy security " as the European Union refocuses on intra-bloc supply chains for its energy needs . The Spanish government announced a Hydrogen Roadmap in 2020 , but the sector has taken on greater importance in Europe since Russia 's invasion of Ukraine . Russia is the world 's second-largest producer of natural gas , which powers most global hydrogen production . The International Energy Agency said in December that Spain would account for half of Europe 's growth in dedicated renewable capacity for hydrogen production . Green hydrogen is created when renewable energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separating its hydrogen and oxygen molecules through electrolysis . The process does n't produce planet-warming carbon dioxide , but less than 0.1% of global hydrogen production is currently created in this way , according to the IEA . The separated hydrogen can be used in the production of steel , ammonia and chemical products , all of which require industrial processes that are harder to wean off fossil fuels . Hydrogen can also be used as a transportation fuel , which could one day transform the highly polluting shipping and aviation sectors . " Renewable energy , including renewable hydrogen , is a central pillar of the REPowerEU Plan , which is the EU 's strategy to get rid of Russian fossil fuels as soon as possible , " said EU Commissioner for Energy , Kadri Simson , in an email . Spain already has 15.5 gigawatts of electrolyzer capacity earmarked for green hydrogen , far higher than the target of four gigawatts set out in the roadmap for 2030 . Spain 's large , windswept and sparsely populated territory receives more than 2,500 hours of sunshine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agency , providing ideal conditions for wind and solar energy , and therefore green hydrogen production . " If you look at where hydrogen is going to be produced in Europe in the next million years , it 's in two countries , Spain and Portugal , " said Thierry Lepercq , the founder and president of HyDeal Ambition , an industry platform bringing together 30 companies . " Hydrogen is the new oil . " Lepercq is working with companies like Spanish gas pipeline corporation Enagas and global steel giant ArcelorMittal to design an end-to-end model for hydrogen production , distribution and supply at a competitive price . Criticism has centered on green hydrogen 's higher cost compared with highly-polluting " gray hydrogen " drawn from natural gas . Lepercq argues that solar energy produced in Spain is priced low enough to compete . While cars and heating solutions for buildings are increasingly electric , other sectors are harder to crack . Globally , Lepercq said , " Electricity , power , is 20% of energy consumption . What about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replace those fossil fuels . Not in 50 years time . You need to replace them now . " HyDeal aims to replace high-emitting processes like using coking coal and blast furnaces in steel manufacturing , and natural gas in ammonia production for fertilizers . It must first build solar farms and electrolyzers in northern Spain , joining other green hydrogen plants recently inaugurated in central Spain and Mallorca . The European Commission has proposed that the bloc produce 10 million metric tons of renewable hydrogen by 2030 and to import 10 million metric tons more . Hydrogen consumption in Spain is currently around 500,000 metric tons per year , mainly produced from natural gas and used in refineries and chemical production . By 2030 , the EU is attempting to cut emissions in the bloc by 55% compared to 1990 levels . Spain , France , Germany and Portugal have agreed to build a hydrogen pipeline by 2030 to transport some 2 million metric tons of hydrogen to France annually -- 10% of the EU 's estimated hydrogen needs . Hydrogen presents challenges for transportation as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ribera , the Spanish minister , knows green hydrogen requires an upfront investment that will only pay off in the long term . Slashing emissions " needs an initial stage that can be covered with renewable energies , " she said in an interview with The Associated Press , adding that for sectors like heating and transport , " it 's fundamental to electrify . " Spain , she continued , would also need to cut fossil fuels for " end uses for which electricity is not so simple . " A huge amount of extra renewable power generation will be required to build a green hydrogen future . The IEA says the world will need 50 gigawatts of renewable capacity dedicated to green hydrogen production by 2027 -- a 100-fold increase . Some industry experts argue the push for green hydrogen is the wrong focus at a delicate tipping point for renewables following the fallout of the Ukraine war for the energy sector . " In Europe in particular , there 's been a huge push for hydrogen , which in my point of view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Renewables Grid Initiative . The EU target of 20 million metric tons of green hydrogen by 2030 requires electricity " that we do n't have the renewable resources to produce , " she added .

Class: Environmental, Family: Climate Change, Comment: Transition to Green Hydrogen, "Spain is positioning itself as Europe 's future leader in green hydrogen production to clean up heavy industries." ArcelorMittal's involvement in green hydrogen projects in Spain indicates a strategic shift towards reducing carbon emissions. However, the transition to green hydrogen involves significant upfront investments and technological challenges, which could impact operational costs and timelines.

Class: Financial, Family: Economic Variables, Comment: Cost of Green Hydrogen, "Criticism has centered on green hydrogen 's higher cost compared with highly-polluting 'gray hydrogen' drawn from natural gas." The higher cost of green hydrogen compared to traditional methods could affect ArcelorMittal's financial performance if the company cannot achieve competitive pricing or if the market does not support the premium for greener products.

Class: Governance, Family: Strategic Performance, Comment: Long-term Investment in Green Hydrogen, "Ribera, the Spanish minister, knows green hydrogen requires an upfront investment that will only pay off in the long term." ArcelorMittal's investment in green hydrogen projects requires careful strategic planning to ensure that the long-term benefits outweigh the initial costs and that the company remains competitive during the transition period.

Class: Technology, Family: Disruptive Technology, Comment: Technological Challenges in Green Hydrogen, "A huge amount of extra renewable power generation will be required to build a green hydrogen future." The technological and infrastructure challenges associated with scaling up green hydrogen production could pose risks to ArcelorMittal's operations if the necessary advancements and investments are not realized in a timely manner.
