# Dataset & Prompt Examples for Risk Detection in E-commerce with LLMs

This repository contains the dataset and a set of prompt examples used in the paper:

**Risk Detection in E-commerce with LLMs: Annotation Challenges and Lessons from Real-world Business News**

The goal of the study is to detect and classify risks in business news articles related to five major e-commerceâ€“linked steel companies: **ArcelorMittal, Tata Steel, POSCO, NLMK, and ThyssenKrupp**. We annotated **121 business news articles** using the **Cambridge Risk Taxonomy** framework and evaluated the performance of two advanced large language models (LLMs) for few-shot risk detection and classification.

These prompt examples illustrate how we structured our inputs for:

- Few-shot classification  
- Risk taxonomy alignment  
- Semantic similarity-based example selection

The dataset comprises news articles published between **2010 and 2023**. Please note: due to copyright constraints in the original dataset, certain words or identifiable terms have been **masked** by replacing them with `@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @`.

The full dataset of annotated articles is available under CC BY-SA 4.0 licence. Please note, you are free to share and adapt the material for any purpose, even commercially, as long as you give appropriate credit.
