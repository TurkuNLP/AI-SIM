India was earlier the third-largest supplier of iron ore in the world , but court restrictions over the past three years to curb illegal mining have prompted companies such as Tata Steel and JSW Steel to turn to imports . A restart of production at Tata Steel 's Noamundi mine should help India 's top steel company lower its reliance on overseas purchases of the steelmaking raw material . The eastern state of Jharkhand , where Tata Steel started mining from the Noamundi mine in 1922 , asked the company to stop operations in September pending a renewal of its lease . But last week a local court asked the state to issue "" express orders "" by Thursday to allow the firm to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 10 million tonnes a year . While the state government was unlikely to be able to issue the orders so quickly , "" mining will resume automatically "" after the court-set deadline , S.I . Minz , additional director of mines in Jharkhand , said on Tuesday . Another official in Jharkhand said the state was yet to decide on the order . Delays in renewing mining leases in Jharkhand and neighbouring Odisha have forced Tata Steel to resort to iron ore imports for the first time in its 107 years . It has bought 3 million tonnes of iron ore this fiscal year that began in March , mostly from overseas and from India 's top producer NMDC . Future imports will depend on the restart of Noamundi and other mines , spokesman Chanakya Chaudhary said . But transportation costs are a concern for the company .

103,@@2758322,2014,Tata,"<h> Jharkhand orders closure of a dozen iron ore mines BHUBANESWAR : The Jharkhand government has ordered closure of a dozen iron ore mines in the state , including those of Tata Steel , SAIL and Orissa Manganese and Minerals , following the Centre 's move to amend mineral concession rules of 1960 under which mining leases for major minerals are given out . A day after issuing the directive , the government served notices to these companies on Thursday , dealing a blow to the steelmakers dependent on raw material from their captive mines in the west Singhbhum region . The closure of mines will also impact companies that buy ore from the market , given the already prevalent shortages in the market . Tata Steel , for instance , has shut its Nuamundi mines , which met 25-30% of the company 's total requirement of raw material and for which it has an environment clearance of 10 mt annually . "" Jharkand government will be seeking clarification from   the central government . Some other miners are also considering seeking clarification from the Supreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who did not wish to be identified . SAIL 's mines impacted by the order include those in Gua , Kiriburu and Budhuburu . As ET had reported on August 27 , the state government 's move was imminent ever since the central ministry of mines amended the mineral concession rules , following the Supreme Court order in May to limit lease extensions without licence renewals . The related notification of July 18 changed the rules to allow a grace period of two years only to those companies which applied for renewals for the first time . By clarifying that the "" deemed provision "" under Rule 24(a) ( 6 ) could not be extended to mines waiting for second or third renewals , it rendered their operations illegal . Experts believe the amendment applies to not just iron ore but also all other minerals including coal , posing a possible challenge to the Narendra Modi-led NDA government at the Centre which is seeking to spur growth . Jharkhand and Odisha together accounted for nearly 70% of India 's iron ore production in 2013-14 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TV Narendran had said the company was in discussion with the Jharkhand government and was hopeful of a resolution . "" It is not in the interest of any stakeholder to stop mining operations , hence nobody wants mining to stop , "" he had said . The Supreme Court order , in a matter concerning Odisha , had forced Naveen Patnaik 's BJD government to stop operations at 26 mines that awaited second or subsequent renewals for their leases . The state , as directed by the court has allowed some mines of SAIL and Tata Steel to restart , with several conditions including getting clearances from the central ministry of environment and forests . The temporary closure forced Tata Steel to import iron ore . Miners say the conditions imposed by the apex court are impossible to meet . Justice AK Patnaik , who had delivered the order in Supreme Court and has since retired , had told ET that the notification was in keeping with the court 's ruling . "" The execution of the lease is a mere formality . After expiry of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ express order , and as long as the state government has recorded in writing that the renewal was in the interest of mineral development , "" he had said . However , heads of affected mining companies , say officials in the Jharkhand government were of the view that such leases lapsed the day the gazette notification was issued , on July 18 . Rajesh Bansal , a former sustainability head at Federation of Indian Mineral Industries , said miners had suffered not only because of undue delays in renewals , largely at the state level , but also because they were forced to get fresh green clearance at the time of renewals , even for areas that had been mined for decades . "" The Mines and Minerals ( Development and Regulation ) Bill of 2011 had sought to correct this by terming ' renewal ' as ' extension ' . The mines ministry could have amended MMDR Act and MCR in that spirit , "" said Bandal . Several commissions have slammed the abuse of this deemed provision under the recently modified Rule 24(a) ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former Supreme Court judge Justice MB Shah had blamed the delays on "" the inherited bureaucratic methodology imbued with corruption , note-sheet making , file-pushing , non-responsiveness and passing on the buck to others "" .","Class: Geopolitical, Family: Government Business Policy, comment: Emerging Regulation, The Jharkhand government has ordered closure. following the Centre’s move to amend mineral concession rules.

We have been covering this report for 6-7 years now , and unfortunately , rather than improving , sadly India is deteriorating further . The latest report released by the World Bank on Tuesday places India at No. 142 , just ahead of the war battered economies like Palestine , West Bank and Gaza , out of a total of 189 countries . This is fall of 2 ranks compared to last year . Here is how India ranks on various parameters of Doing Business : On a global level , Singapore was placed at the top of the rankings . Other countries which got a mention in the Top 10 list include New Zealand , South Korea , United States , United Kingdom and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was placed at a not-so-enviable No. 90 . Other Indian neighbors were marginally better with Sri Lanka being placed at 99 , Nepal at 108 and Pakistan at 128 . Only Bangladesh at 173 and Afghanistan at 183 were behind India , as if that is some consolation ! The methodology used for ranking has always been a debatable issue . It has also , at times , created tensions between the bank and its member countries . Though the World Bank on its part asserts that their rankings "" offer an unvarnished assessment of economies ' relative standings in the world when it comes to bureaucratic barriers to business , "" the countries languishing at the bottom of the table have raised question marks about their reliability . The most vocal on this front has been China . Undoubtedly one of the major influencers on the business scene globally , the economic giant was so miffed with being placed at No. 90 persistently that it tried to ' kill ' the rankings altogether in 2013 . Keeping in view the grouses of the member countries and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the rankings 2015 has been changed . The changed methodology has made little difference , if at all , to both the Asian behemoths and they still have to go a long way to work their way to the top of the table , to reflect favorably on their business friendly atmosphere . India 's rankings were bad because it did badly on all parameters laid by the governing body , except three : Though starting business in India has been made cheaper by reducing the registration fee , it has also been made a tardier and long-drawn process , thanks to a new declaration that new businesses will be required to make . Managing to get a power connection in two of India 's major commercial hubs , Mumbai and New Delhi , has also become cheaper as the security deposit required for the purpose was slashed . Besides that , measures have been initiated to protect the interests of minority investors by trying to make boardroom proceedings more transparent and also safeguarding the interests of shareholders in privately held companies . India @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Doing Business reports released by the World Bank but there is no doubting that a lot remains to be done to make doing business in India easier . While getting a power connection in Singapore ( the no. 1 placed country ) takes upto 31 days on an average , doing so in India might take upto 105 days . Now , that is a HUGE difference , admittedly ! Similarly while it takes 4.5 days to register for a new property in Singapore , it takes 47 days in India . Resolving insolvency which takes a maximum of 10 months in the tiny speck of that island nation could take upto 4.3 years in India . Much is being said about India being only marginally ahead of war ravaged economies like West Bank and Gaza . But the size of a nation and its political turmoil should not be the benchmarks with which you judge the ease with which a new business can be set up . Singapore , for that matter , is barely visible on the World map . It continues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , friendly laws and keeping the investor interest in mind above everything else . Being placed behind Nepal and Pakistan can be a contentious issue though . Before questioning the methodology or credibility of the rankings , there is a lot of introspection to be done as to why we continue to be placed at the position we find ourselves in at present . Hmmmm .... Altaf Rahman I really like your analysis and Observations because you really pinpointed them out and these kind of attitude from the Government can never allow Growth whatsoever but like the case has always been , maybe they just gave it to India because of their self Interest in the giving or maybe a Political Ambition . Lets think from out side to inwards . Suppose you are a businessman with bags full of money and a pet project . You want to set shop . Where will you go ? You go to the most friendly place . Though it hurts to see the rankings , we have to accept the facts . Let me give few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you feel . POSCO , the South Korean Steel gaint wanted to invest in India and Indian govt was happy because the project was huge with lots of foreign investment and potential for lots of jobs . What happened ?

Trading is likely to start from 2012 and is part of a two-step plan by the government to mandate emissions cuts by big polluters . The trading scheme will allow firms to set a market price for carbon and other industrial emissions . South Korea last year set a 2020 emissions reduction target , aiming to curb greenhouse gases by 30 percent from projected levels if no action were taken . Although the target is voluntary , the government will impose regulations to force major emitters to comply as part of the nation 's efforts in the broader international fight against climate change .

While the environment ministry supervises the overall scheme , four ministries will set individual emission targets for 600 leading companies responsible for 70 percent of the country 's total emissions , or more than 90 percent of industrial emissions . The master plan will be set up by September . The biggest emitters , which produced more than 125,000 tonnes of CO2 in the past three years , will be given a grace period before they are subject to mandatory cuts . This extra time is designed to help them set up implementation plans , which are to be submitted by March 2011 . They must begin taking action by April 2011 . No detailed incentives or penalties for the cuts have been decided . Major emitters include the world 's biggest electronics firm by revenue Samsung Electronics ( 005930 .

The bill will decide the ministry to run the plan from among Knowledge Economy , Environment or Strategy and Finance . The actual trading plan will be managed by either Korea Power Exchange , Korea Exchange or a new commodities exchange to trade emissions . Korea Exchange has been promoting emissions trading and possible derivative products and is looking at cross-listing emissions products traded on other international exchanges . With the bill , the presidential committee plans to adopt a "" cap-and-trade "" plan , under which firms facing a greenhouse gas emission limit can buy allowances from other polluters to stay under their emissions cap .

Made from an amalgam of steel , aluminum , carbon , manganese , and nickel , the new alloy promises to be low-cost and readily available due to its mix of common minerals . Previous research into lightweight steel has focused on mixing in aluminum in varying proportions to attempt to reduce the density , and therefore the weight .

The Indian tycoon scooped up Tetley Tea and Jaguar Land Rover in the UK , New York 's Pierre Hotel and South Korean truck maker Daewoo . However , the industrialist 's most ambitious acquisition came on January 31 , 2007 , when Tata Steel finally triumphed over Brazilian rival Cia . Siderurgica Nacional ( CSN ) in a bidding war for Corus , the FTSE 100 steelmaker forged from the 1999 merger of British Steel with Dutch rival Hoogovens . But despite the victory , the Indian firm 's shares dropped almost 11pc . Tata Steel 's winning bid valued Corus -- the owner of the Port Talbot steelworks -- at ? 6.2bn , much higher than the Indian firm 's ? 4.1bn initial approach . The battle with CSN had forced Tata Steel to ramp-up its bid and investors were now worried about the price and debt the Indian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tata , whose great grandfather founded parent company Tata , was confident in his gamble on British steel . "" Quite frankly I do feel the stock market is both taking a short-term and harsh view , "" he declared defiantly . "" In future , somebody will look back and say we did the right thing . "" Almost a decade later , however , and Tata Steel has finally conceded it got it wrong . On Wednesday , just hours after the company revealed it was putting its UK steel assets up for sale , Koushik Chatterjee , Tata Steel 's finance director , admitted the British businesses now had a book value of "" almost zero "" . The UK division 's fate was decided at a marathon seven-hour meeting on Tuesday evening in Mumbai , when Tata 's board -- led by chairman Cyrus Mistry , who succeeded Ratan Tata in 2012 -- rejected a turnaround plan for the assets that once made up British Steel . As many as 40,000 jobs are under threat if a buyer for all or parts of Tata @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biggest steel plant in Port Talbot -- is not found . David Cameron , the Prime Minister , has warned there is "" no guarantee "" the Government can save Tata 's sites and cautioned he does n't believe nationalisation "" is the right answer "" . The closure of Tata 's operations would sound the death knell for what remains of Britain 's steel industry . Given the state of Tata Steel UK 's finances , it is a wonder the Indian conglomerate kept the operations running for as long as it did . The UK steel business is losing over ? 1m a day and since 2010 Tata has taken ? 2bn in impairments on the division . Annual pre-tax losses at Tata Steel UK more than doubled to ? 768m in the 12 months to the end of March last year , despite the business generating revenues of about ? 4.2bn . However , those sales were down 7pc on 2014 and were wiped out last year by nearly ? 4.5bn in operating costs , of which raw materials and consumables accounted for almost half . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scheme could also prove an obstacle to any rescue . The scheme has approximately 130,000 members and liabilities approaching ? 15bn , although the deficit was reduced to ? 485m last year . Tata could still be forced to make a contribution , or the Government could step in . The exit from the UK would mean Tata Steel 's Dutch assets will be its only European business , and there were suggestions on Friday it could combine the operation with those of Germany 's ThyssenKrupp . Whatever the fate of Tata 's Dutch division , however , the end of its British steel interests appears unavoidable , marking the end of a disastrous era for the Indian giant . In many respects , its exit has been partly caused by the debt Tata Steel assumed when it first entered Britain with the Corus deal . Nine years ago , the takeover of Corus catapulted Tata onto the world stage . At the time Ratan Tata hailed the move "" as the first big step that the Indian industry has taken in the international marketplace ... as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ? 6.2bn deal signalled investor unease . Tata contributed $4.1bn to fund the takeover , raised a further $6.1bn in debt and used a bridge loan . A host of factors have since conspired against British steelmakers and their rivals in Europe . Steel prices have collapsed as cheap imports from unprofitable Chinese producers have flooded into Europe and the UK . A record 112m tonnes of steel were exported from China last year and the steel industry has accused Beijing of "" dumping "" it in the EU . "" There 's a perfect storm across Europe that we 've been at the centre of in the UK , "" says Dominic King , the head of policy at UK Steel . However , exacerbating the situation in the UK has been the Government 's stance towards steelmaking . Business rates on heavy industry in the UK are much higher than elsewhere in Europe ; steelmakers pay far more for electricity than rivals in Europe ; and the British Government has been accused of impeding EU measures to combat Chinese dumping . Tata Steel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the UK business . Since the Corus deal , it is understood the firm has invested ? 1.5bn in new plant and technology , and spent a further ? 2bn on raw materials and other investments . However , Tata Steel 's ability to weather the storm in the steel industry has been weakened by its borrowings , which totalled $11bn in net debts as of the end of last year and have put huge pressure on its balance sheet . At the same time , the steel crisis in the UK has only deepened . SSI decided to close the Redcar steelworks last October , and just days later Caparo Industries collapsed . So it is surprising ministers have been caught off-guard by the turn of events at Tata , which had been regularly updating the Government its situation . On Tuesday , Sajid Javid , Britain 's business secretary , was arriving in Australia for a trade mission during Tata 's board meeting to decide the future of the UK steel division . The Prime Minister was at the tail-end of a family holiday in Lanzarote . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British steel 's woes , but analysts believe it will be hard to find a buyer for every part of Tata Steel , particularly Port Talbot , with its expensive-to-run furnaces . Private equity firm Greybull is still to complete its deal to buy Tata 's Scunthorpe steelworks , a purchase that is expected within days , and so is not thought to be in the running to rescue further sites . An offer from a Chinese firm is also considered unlikely . However , just as Ratan Tata shook up British steelmaking in 2007 , a solution to the industry 's current crisis may be found in another Indian businessman . Sanjeev Gupta , founder of commodities firm Liberty House , is interested not just in buying some of Tata 's steel processing assets , but in working with ministers and Tata to find a future for Port Talbot .

Class: Social, Family: Brand Perception, comment: Reputation and Negative Media Coverage, POSCO wants to build the mill in eastern Orissa state , but has faced delays arising from green clearance issues and protests by local residents who say the plant will disrupt their largely agriculture and forest-based livelihoods. The protests from local residents will likely result in negative media coverage for POSCO. The negative brand perception surrounding the displacement of local communities and the environmental concerns raised could damage POSCO’s reputation. This risk is related to the potential public relations issues the company might face.
Class: Governance, Family: Process Risk, comment: Project Delay & Execution Risk, POSCO was scheduled to begin production from its plant in Orissa 's Kujanga region by the end of 2011 . The pact for the mill was signed in June 2005 and also included captive iron ore mining rights in the state 's Khandadhar area. The delays and uncertainty around the project if the court case and regulatory hurdles continue. Legal and regulatory obstacles have delayed the plant’s completion, representing significant execution risk.

The resistance was largely because the betel-based economy sustained 20,000-odd people in eight villages in Dhinkia , Nuagaon and Gadakujanga gram panchayats that would be affected by the project . And about 3,000 acres of the 4,004 acres of land required for the steel plant was to come from forestland , its sandy landscape dotted with around 5,000 betel vines . The vineyards gave farmers here an assured average income of at least Rs 20,000 per month . A villager in his betel vineyard , which was dismantled during the land acquisition process in 2013 . With the project stuck , he re-erected the vines in 2015 .

Police cases were lodged against many anti-Posco activists , including women , who , in their attempt to avoid arrest , lost out on their livelihoods . The district administration carried out the land acquisition in two phases -- in 2011 and 2013 . In the first phase , residents of Nuagaon willingly allowed their betel vines and fruit-bearing trees , mostly cashew nut , to be torn down in exchange for compensation . But fierce resistance in other villages , especially by hundreds of children and women who blocked entry points to the vineyards by squatting on the sand in the scorching summer heat , forced the administration to suspend the land acquisition for the next two years .

A hoarding marking the entry point to the project site at Balitutha . It announces the state-run Industrial Infrastructure Development Corporation as the "" friendly facilitator "" of the project . <h> Regulation roadblock Still , not a brick was laid in the project area . There were several reasons for this . Though the steel plant was central to the ambitious project , it had two other vital components -- a port and a mine that Posco was confident of building . Many Posco officials maintained the port and mine were indispensable for the project . So confident was Posco about clinching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paradip Port , a few kilometres from the project site , for separate berths exclusively for its use . Mining experts speculate that Posco 's non-negotiable stand on getting the captive mine and port was driven by its intention to source iron ore from the Khadadhar hill in mineral-rich Sundargarh district at dirt cheap rates -- Rs 1,200 a tonne against the market rate of Rs 3,500 per tonne . However , in January 2015 , an amendment of the Mine and Minerals Development and Regulation Act -- in the wake of allegations of mining scams across the country , including in Odisha -- put a spanner in Posco 's plans . Under the amended law , it was now mandatory for the company to go through the auction route to get its captive iron ore mine . Earlier , the state government had promised to help it obtain the mining licence for free . Thereafter , Posco completely lost interest in the project , which was now as good as dead -- though a formal announcement took another two years to come . <h> Ruined economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ August 2015 , a few battered and broken prefabricated shipping containers were all that remained of Posco 's site office on a deserted swathe of sand . The villagers had already demarcated the "" Posco land "" with small plants and stones and divided it among themselves . All that remains of Posco 's site office in Nuagaon village in 2015 . In villages like Gobindpur , where the administration had acquired land in the face of stiff resistance , villagers had re-erected their betel vines and resumed cultivation . Though it is the end of the road for Posco , the damage that has been done to the area seems irreparable . Lakhs of stumps of what were once cashew nut and other fruit-bearing trees are tell-tale signs of livelihoods lost and an ecology devastated . Today , Nuagaon , the village that backed Posco , is a picture of despair : its residents have exhausted their compensation amounts and are left with no other means to sustain themselves . More than a half of the village is unemployed . Those who owned betel vines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living as daily-wage labourers in the vineyards of Dhinkia , which survived the land acquisition .

And on Sunday , Union Coal and Power Minister Piyush Goyal said that there are other companies that can replace Posco . Such statements show that no lessons have been learnt from the over-decade-long Posco fiasco . For if the state government decides to give the land to any other big ticket investor , it would have to reclaim this land from the people and risk triggering another grassroots resistance movement .

A well-positioned skylight can fill a room with natural light and make a huge difference to small rooms as well as large living areas . However , skylights must be intelligently designed to suit the climate and the room . Skylights facing north , if on a sloping roof , will bring in soft light , while a skylight on a flat roof will bring in sharp glare in the afternoons . In the Indian climate , a skylight will definitely reduce the need for artificial lighting but could also increase the need for air-conditioning during the warm months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

While the form and material depend significantly on practical considerations , there are several trendy options . Floating staircases are hugely popular in modern , minimalist homes and add lightness to a normally heavy structure .

17,@@1493783,2010,Posco,"<h> UPA-2 : Time to change course May 21 , 2010 19:26 IST The government must give up its neo-liberal polices and obsession with GDP growth and shift its ideological centre of gravity leftwards , argues Praful Bidwai . It 's no aberration that the first anniversary of the return to power of the United Progressive Alliance should coincide with a tsunami of grassroots protests : From Orissa to Maharashtra , and from Tamil Nadu to Uttarakhand , through tribal Madhya Pradesh , Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand . The protests represent popular resistance to UPA-2 's industrialisation and mining policies and its zealous promotion of gross domestic product growth as an end in itself . Central here is the displacement and dispossession of vulnerable people . The government 's response to the protests has been to unleash repression by arresting their leaders and firing upon peaceful protesters . This is what happened last week in Orissa 's Jagatsinghpur district where large-scale demonstrations were organised against land acquisition for a giant steel plant of the South Korea-based company , Posco . The police imposed prohibitory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearby villages . Although Orissa has a non-UPA government , its approach towards the Posco project is similar to the UPA 's . Indeed , it 's even more ardent in pushing it than the Centre , which at least insists that Posco obtain proper environmental clearance . Lest it be thought that the Posco Pratirodh Sangram Samiti leaders are extremists , they belong to the Communist Party of India which has sustained the agitation for years . The Samiti has been on a dharna near Paradip port since January 26 . Recently , even the Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party joined or backed the protests . Last week , the police arrested CPI MP Bibhu Prasad Tarai and two Congress leaders ' as a preventive measure ' , opened fire , and injured more than 100 protesters . The Orissa police , never known for efficient law enforcement , have a record of brutality in dealing with movements which dare to oppose powerful interests . An example is the notorious firing at Kalinganagar in Jajpur district on January 2 , 2006 , in which 14 people were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost their limbs to the landmines planted by the police -- an indefensible use of a deadly weapon against the civilian population . On May 12 , the police again opened fire , killing one . As the Orissa events unfolded , Maharashtra 's Ratnagiri district saw a powerful march through several villages against another destructive UPA-promoted project -- a nuclear park , with six reactors , each of 1,600 MW , to be built at Jaitapur . Areva , the French company that is building them , is under interrogation on safety issues by the French nuclear regulatory agency . Areva 's design for the first reactor contracted in Western Europe after Chernobyl ( 1986 ) , at Olkiluoto in Finland , has fallen foul of Finnish , French and British regulators . The plant has been delayed by three-and-a-half years and is 60 percent over budget . Welding has been frozen since last October . If the project fails or is abandoned , it will sound the death-knell of the nuclear industry in the developed world . Yet , oblivious of all this -- and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promoting the Jaitapur project with memorable zeal . Although no contract has been drawn up , no project report prepared , and the site has n't received environmental clearance , the government is acquiring land under the emergency provisions of the colonial Land Acquisition Act of 1894 . The people oppose the project on grounds of safety and loss of land and livelihoods and have torn up the cheques they received ' in compensation ' . They do n't want to live in the vicinity of six big nuclear reactors , each larger than the Chernobyl plant , which will routinely emit radioactivity , and which could all undergo a catastrophic accident poisoning thousands of square miles . Unless the government rethinks its ill-conceived plan to build nuclear parks at coastal sites -- including Gujarat , Andhra Pradesh , Orissa , Tamil Nadu and West Bengal -- a nasty confrontation will assuredly occur . This raises issues of great gravity : Does local democracy , for which the UPA claims much credit , going back to Rajiv Gandhi 's 73rd and 74th Constitutional amendments , have any meaning ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a population that does n't feel secure or comfortable with it ? Should it persist with an energy technology that has proved costly and high-risk , and is declining the world over , when it has no agencies that can cope with emergencies , especially a deadly radioactivity crisis ? Similar questions are being posed by millions of people who oppose the gigantic loot of public resources called Special Economic Zones , petrochemicals investment regions , and projects in extractive industries like coal , bauxite , metallurgy and cement . No such project goes unopposed . The government and the promoters can not convince the people that their objections to livelihood destruction are irrational or unwarranted , that they will receive adequate compensation , and that alternative employment will materialise . Independent India 's experience with ' development ' projects has been dismal : Displacement of 45 million , the population of more than three-fourths of the world 's nations , with little rehabilitation . Even the Supreme Court has expressed concern at such violations of the right to life and asked that the Land Acquisition Act be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it says that land acquisition unrelated to public welfare is indefensible and causes trauma . ' It also creates hostility , mutual distrust and disharmony among the villagers , dividing them along the lines of "" those who can influence and get their land deleted "" and "" those who can not "" . Touts and middlemen flaunting political connections flourish , extracting money ... Why subject such a large number of citizens to such traumatic experience ? ' Underway in India today is a process of ' enclosure ' of land , similar to what happened in Western Europe three centuries ago , but much more compressed . This comes on top of a prolonged agrarian crisis , a 10-kg decrease in monthly per-capita foodgrain consumption over three decades , and the suicides of 200,000 farmers since 1997 -- historically unprecedented anywhere . Small-holder agriculture has become unviable in two-thirds of India . Farm incomes have n't kept pace with rising input costs . Agriculture has become more energy- , water- and capital-intensive and suffers from falling public investment , monoculture and high water use , rising imports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has also run up against major ecological barriers . Instead of addressing these issues , and promoting equitable growth and defending vulnerable livelihoods , the UPA is blindly pursuing neo-liberal approaches that have proved bankrupt the world over and are creating havoc domestically . Unless it quickly corrects course , the UPA will betray the promise of inclusive growth which was critical to its election victory in 2009 . Worse , it will get into a hostile confrontation with underprivileged people , undermine their subsistence , further distort growth processes and aggravate inequalities and disparities , thus sharpening social conflict . This is the surest recipe for breeding Naxalism where it does n't exist and exacerbating social divisions . Regrettably , not many UPA leaders are prepared to demand a policy review and correction along radical lines . Some Congress leaders like Mani Shankar Aiyar and Digvijay Singh , and sometimes Rahul Gandhi , express genuine concern about persistent destitution , rising income inequalities , and the state 's loss of popular credibility . Sonia Gandhi has decided to re-establish the National Advisory Council , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The National Rural Employment Guarantee Act too has had a positive impact . However , this is not nearly enough . The very content and the direction of the growth process has to change if it is not to remain predatory on the people . Some leaders refuse to go so radical . They are content to promote vigorous GDP growth regardless of its demands on human and natural resources , its origins in sleaze , criminality and dirty deals , and its inequality-enhancing nature . They believe faster growth will boost state revenues , which the government can target at worthy schemes like the NREGA to help the poor . This view is not as callous as the widely discredited ' trickle down ' approach . But it is badly flawed . It underestimates both the severity of the destruction wrought by neo-liberalism and the double injustice of further punishing and dispossessing people who live in wretched deprivation and are already at the bottom of the heap in this super-hierarchical society . It is not enough that the fruits of rapid growth are used to redress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself . Growth , or rather development , must become inherently inclusive , immanently equitable and based on people 's participation and consent . Sustainable development must be need-based , green and gender-just . It must not negate the worthy ethical imperative of defending the rights and interests of the poorest of the poor -- not even temporarily . The Congress must debate these issues . Or , it will drift into the same policy frame that eventually brought about the Bharatiya Janata Party 's election defeat . Regrettably , this decade is probably the first time that the Congress is in power without a left-of-centre pressure group or think tank within , like the Nehru Forum or the Young Turks , which is sorely needed . This is a void that far exceeds the government 's many political management errors , which have attracted all the media attention as UPA-2 completes its first year in power . The NAC could bring progressive inputs into policy-making if Sonia Gandhi broadens its membership and shifts its ideological centre of gravity leftwards .","Class: Geopolitical, Family: Political Violence, comment: Land Acquisition & Civil Unrest, Large-scale demonstrations were organised against land acquisition for a giant steel plant of the South Korea-based company, Posco.

The picture could n't look more different today . Thanks to China 's decision to dramatically cut capacity while boosting infrastructure spending , added to the improved outlook for global growth and increased protectionism , prices have surged some 45% since December 2015 . A boom in mergers and acquisitions has followed , with investors competing to fork out billions for steel companies once considered nigh on worthless . Germany 's Thyssenkrupp struck a deal in February to sell money-losing Brazilian steel mill CSA to Ternium SA ( TX.N ) for US$1.3 billion . India 's Tata Steel , which threatened to shut its loss-making UK assets last April , is now in talks to merge its UK and European plants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example of the turnaround is in the bidding war for Ilva , in Taranto , southeast Italy . Europe 's largest and most troubled steel plant , Ilva has racked up hundreds of millions of euros worth of losses since coming under government stewardship in 2013 . The plant has been dogged by charges of corruption and environmental crime for years . In 2012 , Italian authorities ruled emissions of dust and cancer-causing chemicals from the plant caused hundreds of deaths and abnormal levels of tumours and respiratory disease in the Taranto region . About half the plant 's 11-million-tonne annual steelmaking capacity was eventually mothballed , senior managers and executives were arrested and 8 billion euros of assets were seized from the Riva Group , Ilva 's former owners . Yet two consortiums -- one including ArcelorMittal , the world 's top steelmaker , and the other involving Indian steelmaker JSW -- are now vying to spend around 4 billion euros buying , upgrading and cleaning the plant , betting that imports into Europe will decline just as the economy picks up . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "" With reduced import volumes , Ilva 's additional output will be absorbed . The domestic market is not booming but it is growing , and we should continue to see a steady increase in industrial activity in Europe , "" Tommaso Sandrini , president of Italian steel processors association Assofermet , told Reuters . Renewed M&amp;A activity is expected to lead in turn to capacity cuts which will further boost prices , they say . Of the Tata merger , Thyssenkrupp 's chief financial officer Guido Kerkhoff said : "" The most important thing for us is that by a consolidation ... we can address the issues of overcapacity . "" CHINA CAPACITY CUTS As with so many sectors of the global economy today , China is the key to the reversal of steel 's fortunes . The world 's top steel maker in early 2016 said it would to cut 100-150 million tonnes of steel capacity by 2020 as part of efforts to tackle pollution and curb excess supply . It cut 60 million tonnes of steel capacity last year alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cut another 50 million tonnes this year . The cuts coincide with a 700-billion-dollar stimulus splurge targeted at infrastructure and construction that prompted a 73% jump in Chinese steel prices last year and a 3.5% fall in Chinese exports . Exports have dropped a further 25% this year . Soaring prices have translated into big gains for steel company shares . Global steel equities are up 80% since plumbing 12-year lows last January . The World Steel Association expects steel demand in developed economies to grow 0.7% this year and 1.2% next , with eurozone interest rates and tax policy set to remain on a steady course and the United States seen benefiting from tax cuts and rising infrastructure spending .

The EU currently has 39 anti-dumping and anti-subsidy measures in place on steel , 17 directed at China and most of which have been put in place over the past couple of years . Across the pond , US steelmakers are getting an even more pronounced boost from a string of steel trade barriers put in place under the Barack Obama administration which are poised to multiply under President Donald Trump . The Trump administration said last month it will invoke a seldom-used provision of law to launch a probe into whether imports of Chinese and other foreign-made steel are a US national security risk . That will come on top of some 150 anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties already in place on steel imports , according to the Cato Institute , a think tank . China 's exports to the United States fell 56% last year , mostly due to these measures , some of which are as high as 500% , according to the International Steel Statistics Bureau . "" The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game and many other countries will be out too , considering the number of anti-dumping investigations in place , "" Sandrini said . Berenberg analyst Alessandro Abate told Reuters Ilva 's privatisation alone will see EU steel prices rise by 10-20 euro per tonne as regional buyers pay a premium for supply which , relative to imports , is of higher quality and can be delivered quickly and reliably . The new owners of Ilva and of the Tata-Thyssenkrupp assets are also expected to employ a more disciplined pricing strategy going forward -- holding out for higher prices and taking pains not to over-supply the market , unlike in the past when Ilva , and to a lesser extent Tata , favoured volumes over price . Alistair Ramsay , research manager at Metal Bulletin Research ( MBR ) , said he disagreed with talk of "" peak steel demand "" , and pointed to consistent annual imports into Europe over the past few years of 5 million tonnes of hot rolled coil , the main steel product used by white goods manufacturers .

This reflects a market demand uncertainty risk. Since demand is heavily tied to the construction and infrastructure sectors, any weakness there directly threatens sales volumes and competitiveness.
Class: Financial, Family: Company Outlook, comment: Investor Negative Outlook, Net profits at Russia’s biggest steel producer, NLMK, fell 6 percent year-on-year in the third quarter of 2016 and analysts expect weaker earnings in the fourth quarter. Profits at Evraz, the country’s second-biggest producer, plunged 63 percent.

Lakes , which support biodiversity , are slowly falling prey to pollutants and effluents that flow into them . While lake rehabilitation efforts from the authorities have been tardy , here is a story of Kyalasanahalli Lake 's rehabilitation by a group of residents , that should warm the cockles of your heart and make us all hopeful for the future . At the heart of this story is 73-year-old , silver haired B Muthuraman , the ex-Vice Chairman of Tata Steel , whose tireless efforts have now turned the site of a dried-up Kyalasanahalli lake bed , which had become a dumping ground , into a sparkling lake . Muthuraman had constructed a house in front of this lake in 2009 and moved to Bengaluru in 2014 . "" I always loved Bengaluru for its lakes and climate . But it was really disheartening that a lake in front of my residence had dried up . "" B Muthuraman moved to Bengaluru in 2014 and was ' disheartened ' that the lake in front of his house had dried up Fortunately , Muthuraman met Anand Malligawad , head of Corporate Social Responsibility ( CSR ) at Sansera Foundation , which had announced a Rs 1 crore budget for environment rehabilitation . It was then that he started planning a lake rehabilitation project with the help of the Foundation , and his neighbours . Although the money was secured , there was much to do . "" I visited the Tahshildar 's office in Jigani , regularly , for five months , before I could get the necessary clearances . Then we had to survey the lake . But the government authorities refused to conduct the survey and private consultants demanded about Rs 30 lakh . So we decided to work with the boundary line of the lake as recorded by the Lake Development Authority ( LDA ) and began the rehabilitation , "" he said . Talking about the process , Malligawad said , "" We did the bhoomi pooja in April 2017 and then realised that this needed a lot of manpower . Both Muthuraman and I visited nearly 400 houses in the area and we were lucky that the residents showed a lot of interest . Once the work started , many young people would turn up at 9 am and work till late in the evening . ' ' Muthurman said they did not appoint engineers , architects or structural engineers . "" We started work with three earth movers and six trucks . With the help of this equipment , the residents were able to remove about 3.60 lakh cubic metres of mud from this lake . We created five islands in another 10 days . In another 25 days , we were able to remove about 1 lakh cubic metres of mud from the lake , "" he said . In June , they diverted two canals of a stormwater drain to a distance of about 1.8 km away from the lake , says Anand . An NGO joined hands to donate saplings and about 1,800 techies working in Electronics City helped to plant 15,000 saplings in just two hours . The miracle finally happened in September , when , due to the rains , water started collecting in the 36-acre lake bed and the lake which had been dry for nearly two decades slowly came alive , ' ' said Anand . Pointing to the centre of the lake , Muthuraman says , "" Can you see the centre of this lake ? Once it was a playground but now it has 18 feet of water . This is the power of people coming together to achieve a common goal . This was possible only because everyone has affection , memories and gratitude towards the environment that sustains us , "" said Muthuraman . Sheshappa , a 57-year-old resident of the area recalls the times when this lake was alive . "" When I was young , all of us friends would gather here . If you live near a lake , you will know how wonderful it is to take a walk around the lake in the evenings , breathe in the fresh air and watch the fish come to the surface to be fed . "" Thankfully for Sheshappa this is no longer just a memory.Venkata Ramappa , another resident of Kyalasanahalli said , "" It feels good to see the lake revived . A walk around the lake could rid you of the frustration of navigating traffic on Bengaluru 's roads . If you have a lake in the neighbourhood that needs reviving , I would highly recommend you do it . ' ' Adds Malligawad : "" To develop a lake , you do n't need to invest crores of money . It just requires the collective efforts of citizens . Whenever I visit this lake now , I feel a kind of satisfaction that 's hard to describe . Lakes are a crucial part of Bengaluru 's identity , and we have to preserve these gifts of nature .

As gender diversity is becoming a key priority for India 's organizations , one key issue is how to encourage women to the workforce since women 's participation in the labor force in India has been declining . India has many well-trained women staying at home , unable to work because they can not get out of their homes since they are primary caretakers . If they try to get back to work after they have been away for years , they frequently face the refusal of employers who look down on their career break . For most women across India , household chores and childcare are provided in addition to their regular duties . Jobs for Her 's survey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage . A significant portion of them relocates to Tier 2/3 cities in a country where work prospects are poor , putting a stop to a woman 's career graph . As WFH is expected to become the practice for a significant section of the workforce in the aftermath of COVID-19 , businesses are opening up new positions targeting women looking for a second shot in the working world since this pandemic has changed the organization 's perspective to promote more WFH involvement . When women leave their jobs for familial responsibilities , it is always difficult for them to get back in . Even when they enter the workforce , they resume at a lower level than their colleagues who have progressed into their professions by then . Many women were not offered the flexibility to follow their careers while raising a family , one of the significant contributors to fewer women leaders in senior positions . The very concept of remote work also enables spouses whose partners have a transferable job to find work . Increasing the opportunities for remote work will make a big difference . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transferable careers . Research demonstrates that heterosexual couples are more likely to move to a man 's work than a woman . Although new studies indicate that that is because of the nature of jobs that men pursue , it also means that women are far more likely to be what is known as the "" trailing wife . "" Remote work enables these women to remain in the same role even though they move to work for their spouse . Now that WFH is set to become a standard in various organizations , it will be easier for those women who have not taken up work or left her career midway due to family obligations . Rigid working hours and lack of remote working options are among the factors that historically kept numerous women away from the job market in the pre-Covid era .

Meanwhile , the number of applications from women job seekers has risen 50% in March compared with a month earlier . An increasing number of companies are opening several earlier roles do not open for women as many of those job roles are turning into work from home . As per JobsForHer data , some of the positions advertised for women comprise data scientists , data engineers , graphic designers , Android developers , customer support assistants , virtual customer support associates , and back end developers .

Studies revealed that female leaders could help the success in business of an organization . In contrast , prospective hires and even stakeholders are continually being challenged by all-male executive leadership . Another significant change that the new normal has resulted in the rise in female entrepreneurship . With the technological revolution , increase in awareness because of better connectivity , more women are taking up entrepreneurship .

Tata Sons is the holding company of India 's largest business conglomerate . It has no operations directly under it and remains to be unlisted too . The media is buzzing with reports of Tata Sons considering creating a CEO post . What 's the Media Buzz ? Media reports suggest that Tata Sons plans to revamp the leadership structure to improve corporate governance . Bloomberg reported the CEO will guide the Tata Sons ' businesses while the chairman will supervise the CEO on behalf of the shareholders . Ratan Tata , Chairman of Tata Trusts , will play the key role in the leadership structure revamp .

"" I believe that it would be good if Armin Laschet became chancellor , "" Jean-Claude Juncker told Playbook in an interview . "" I 'm not a voter in Germany . If I were , I would vote CDU . But that 's no surprise . "" However , Juncker , an astute expert in the politics of his country 's big neighbor since his years as prime minister of Luxembourg , acknowledged that "" from a European point of view , it 's not such an exciting question "" whether Laschet or the Social Democrats ' Olaf Scholz will win : "" Both Scholz and Laschet are grounded Europeans , "" he said -- Laschet via his "" background and career , "" Scholz as per convictions "" which he made his own "" during his time in high office . Fear not , Germans : "" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deficit of influence for Germany , "" Juncker told me in his office at the Commission 's Berlaymont headquarters . Fear not , Europe : "" Europe will remain part of the German raison d ' ? tre , "" Juncker said . "" And so , contrary to popular belief in Germany , everyone in Europe is looking forward to this election calmly , because they know that the next chancellor will not minimize the European dimension of his actions . "" No talk , no issues : The fact that EU policies have n't figured very prominently is n't of great concern for Juncker : "" There is no fundamental dissent between the decisive political forces , "" he said . "" There is not enough talk about Europe . But the fact that people are not arguing about Europe is reassuring . "" On fiscal reform : I passed on to the former Commission president -- and ex-Eurogroup chief -- a question I 've been asked dozens of times in Italy and Greece : Would the SPD 's Scholz be open to relaxing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he makes it into the chancellery ? That 's a no : "" Scholz has already given an answer : He has clearly declared his support for the Stability Pact as it is , "" said Juncker , adding that he believes "" that we do need a flexible interpretation "" of the pact "" because of the pandemic and other reasons . "" Lasciate ogni speranza : "" Greeks and Italians should continue to work seriously , hoping for some marginal goodwill , "" advised Juncker . "" But it will not be the case that debt policy will soon find its way into the eurozone . No matter who becomes chancellor . "" What is Angela Merkel 's most underrated quality ? "" She has listened to everyone -- small , medium , big countries , she never made any distinction , "" said Juncker , who knows what it 's like to be premier of a rather tiny country , and has worked with every German chancellor since Helmut Kohl . "" This also explains her influence in the EU . "" Know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debate in other countries more closely "" than other leaders , said Juncker . "" That was her European political charm , that everyone had the impression that you could tell her things the way they are at home , and she wove that into the overall web of European solutions to which she contributed . "" GUTEN TAG . And with that , we 're back to Berlin for the final stretch of the campaign ... POLLING LATEST : Two new surveys were published today and another pollster is expected to release its final pre-election poll tonight . Our latest Poll of Polls shows a slim advantage for the SPD which remains on 25 percent , the CDU/CSU is down 1 point on 21 percent , the Greens are a point down on 15 percent , the FDP and AfD are on 11 percent , and the Left is on 7 percent . COVERAGE CONTINUES : Our election hub is brimming with new stories published throughout the day . It 's the one-stop shop for news , features and polls . And be sure to check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including on big donations to political parties . LISTEN UP ! We 're trying something new on election night : a live audio chat about the results onTwitter . Join us at 10 p.m . Sunday ! You can set a reminder here . <h> CANDIDATE WATCH The SPD 's Scholz met with the works council and employees of steelmaker ThyssenKrupp in Duisburg earlier today . He 'll stay in North Rhine-Westphalia , Germany 's most populous state , tomorrow to wrap up his campaign . He 'll hold a rally in the university town of M ? nster together with Federal Environment Minister Svenja Schulze and later headline the SPD 's official campaign closing event in Cologne . The CDU 's Laschet held a campaign event in Villingen in the Black Forest region today . He 'll be in Munich tomorrow for the CDU/CSU alliance 's official closing campaign event , along with Merkel and CSU leader Markus S ? der . However , Laschet has also added a final , final event in his home city of Aachen on Saturday , when Merkel will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Annalena Baerbock has a rally this afternoon in Potsdam -- the constituency where she and Scholz are competing for a parliamentary seat . She 'll meet up with her party co-leader , Robert Habeck , in D ? sseldorf tomorrow to close off the Greens ' campaign tour . Christian Lindner , the Free Democrats ( FDP ) leader , will attend his party 's official campaign closing event in Berlin tomorrow evening . But Lindner also has a final event closer to home on Saturday -- he 'll hold a rally in D ? sseldorf on Saturday . FINAL SHOWDOWN : The lead candidates of all the parties represented in the Bundestag take part in a live TV debate tonight . Unlike the debates between the three official candidates for chancellor ( from the CDU/CSU , Greens and SPD ) , this will be a bigger affair , also featuring the CSU 's S ? der , the FDP 's Lindner , the Left 's Janine Wissler , and the Alternative for Germany 's Alice Weidel . The debate is on public channels ARD and ZDF at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , TEFLON CANDIDATE : Just as Merkel was once credited as a "" Teflon "" chancellor because her opponents ' criticism never seemed to stick , the frontrunner seeking to replace her has demonstrated a similar quality : Scholz 's fingerprints may be all over some of the biggest scandals in recent German history , but voters do n't seem to care much . What 's behind the "" Teflon candidate "" ? Hans von der Burchard and Matthew Karnitschnig report from Scholz 's political home turf of Hamburg . LINDNER UNDER FIRE FROM LEFT AND RIGHT : FDP chief Lindner has not enjoyed quite the same media profile as the three candidates for chancellor . But he 's been getting a fair bit of attention recently as the polls suggest a "" traffic light "" coalition between the SPD , the Greens and his party is one of the more likely election outcomes . That has prompted rivals from different ends of the political spectrum to train their fire on the Free Democrats . The CSU 's S ? der accused the FDP of "" signaling to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tie-up with the Social Democrats , even though the party has long been closer to the conservatives . That accusation handily allowed S ? der to argue that there was only one way to vote with certainty for center-right policies -- cast a ballot for the CDU/CSU . "" Airhead "" : Meanwhile , SPD vice chair Kevin K ? hnert , who 's on the left of the party , made clear he is n't keen on a traffic light coalition -- and certainly is n't a fan of Lindner . K ? hnert told the Rheinische Post newspaper that Lindner is an "" airhead "" and a "" gambler who even wants to give tax relief to the super-rich , without having a serious financial concept at the same time . "" Lack of imagination : Lindner himself told NTV today that the FDP is closest to the CDU/CSU . He refused to rule out a traffic light coalition but said he "" currently does not have the imagination "" to see how Scholz could come up with a government that would satisfy K ? hnert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Free Democrats . AFD : LESS FUSS BUT STILL A FORCE : Four years ago , the Alternative for Germany ( AfD ) sent shockwaves through Berlin by becoming the first far-right party to win seats in the Bundestag since the end of World War II . On Sunday , they 're expected to almost match that result , and could even come first in parts of Germany 's east . But this time around , the outcry is likely to be muted , writes POLITICO 's Emily Schultheis . Reporting from an AfD rally in Burgst ? dt , a city in the party 's stronghold of Saxony , she looks at the party 's prospects and the role they 've played in this campaign ( or lack thereof ) . <h> POLL WATCH WHEN WE 'LL KNOW A WINNER : How soon will we know the results of the election after polls close at 6 p.m. on Sunday ? Things move fast in Germany , writes POLITICO 's Cornelius Hirsch . The first figures election-watchers will see will be so-called "" prognoses "" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about their choices after they submit their ballots at the more than 600 voting stations across the country . Pollsters will also have to integrate estimates about mail-in ballots into their exit poll results , especially since this year saw a record number of absentee voters amid the pandemic . Not long after these initial prognoses , broadcasters will post "" result projections "" that integrate some of the first ballots counted . These projections will become more and more accurate as pollsters get results from election offices , though in the past , changes between these results have been slim , with a margin of less than 1 percentage point up or down . In short : We can expect to have a pretty good indication of how Germans voted very early Sunday night . <h> POST-ELECTION PREVIEW COALITION COMPROMISES : The Greens look likely to join the next government , based on the polls , but they 're going to have a tough time as a junior coalition partner , no matter who they team up with . It 's likely going to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joined the government as junior partner of the SPD under Chancellor Gerhard Schr ? der -- since this time the election looks headed toward a three-way tie-up with smaller parties that do n't see eye to eye with the Greens . They 're diametrically opposed to the Left party 's foreign policy objectives as well as the FDP 's tax plans . Things are different this time , argues Frank Brettschneider , a political scientist at the University of Hohenheim . "" Back then , Schr ? der 's social policy reform Agenda 2010 was something that probably caused the Greens some pain , but social policy did n't play the same role for them that it does today , and there was a stronger focus on the environment , "" Brettschneider said , adding that since then , the Greens have become "" much broader "" and started addressing all policy areas . Matter of perspective : Whatever happens , the Greens are going to have to make compromises and will change in the process if they enter government again . "" But that 's also a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is becoming untrue to its ideals ' with a negative touch along the lines of ' they 're power-hungry , ' or do you express the same behavior in a positive frame by saying ' pragmatism has taken hold that also pays attention to the enforceability of political demands , ' "" Brettschneider said . <h> COMMENTARY BOX KEINE ANGST : "" The EU has much to gain from a left-wing alliance in Berlin , "" Diego Velazquez writes of a possible coalition between SPD , Greens and The Left , in a commentary for the Luxemburger Wort newspaper . "" The SPD and The Left could urge Germany to show the economic and financial solidarity that is -- like it or not -- needed in the euro area . And on top of that , the Greens would ensure that Berlin is stricter in its dealings with the Putins and Orb ? ns of this world . It would hardly be a ' total failure ' for Europe . Quite the opposite . "" MISSED CHANCE TO LEAVE THE STONE AGE : "" Nothing intelligent has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to get Germany , with its cash mountains , savings banks , fax machines and mobile-phone-free zones , into the digital 21st century , "" complains Wolfgang M ? nchau in a piece for the Spectator . "" My hunch is that this election will be seen as the moment when Germany missed a unique opportunity to move on from the Merkel years . The Scholz campaign is based on the claim to be Merkel 's natural heir -- an idea she does not like , but one most Germans believe to be true . I suspect voters will choose continuity and reassurance over modernisation and investment . If so , Germany will continue to live a little while longer off the spoils of the golden analogue age and many will continue to wonder in amazement at this ' uncharted territory ' also known as the internet . "" MERKEL 'S MESS : "" Comfortable , cautious Germans seem uninterested in serious debate about the future , "" earning them the prospect of an "" ideologically incoherent three-way coalition ... one that , by combining high-spending greens and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , "" The Economist says in an election assessment that is also a scathing review of Angela Merkel 's track record as chancellor . "" The CDU/CSU , frankly , has blown it , "" the magazine writes , reluctantly endorsing a traffic-light coalition under the leadership of Scholz and including the Greens and the Left as slightly preferable to the "" Jamaica "" option of the CDU/CSU , Greens and FDP . <h> GERMAN BUT FUN FOX NEWS : Conservative Friedrich Merz , who left parliament more than a decade ago after losing a power struggle with Angela Merkel , is running to return to the Bundestag . To show how times have changed , Merz tweeted an old campaign video from 1994 , in which he played on stereotypes of his home region , the Sauerland . The undoubted highlight : a talking fox that speaks with the voice of then-Chancellor Helmut Kohl . ( Even non-German speakers can appreciate this blast from the past , watch here . ) Sadly for Merz , he has not shown the same level of cunning as either his bushy-tailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Merkel and in recent bids for the CDU leadership , he 's been outfoxed.","Class: Geopolitical, Family: Change in Government, comment: SPD, The SPD 's Scholz met with the works council and employees of steelmaker ThyssenKrupp in Duisburg earlier today .

26,@@4341545,2011,Tata,"<h> The perplexing perpetual bonds Despite the odds , perpetual bonds have been a hit with insurers and pension funds abroad on the lookout for long-term avenues to park their funds . September 25 , 2011 : The UK government is said to have pioneered perpetual bonds to finance Napoleon wars . It now issues perpetual bonds under the name of consol , but heaven forbid , should the uninitiated , without the understanding of its grave implications , invest in these bonds , there is no way they can be consoled if things go wrong for them and the market is down . <h> EQUITY SHAREHOLDERS Perpetual bonds are said to have the characteristics of both equity and debt . They carry a fixed coupon rate of interest , which is naturally a few notches higher than that on bonds that are redeemable , to compensate for the money permanently locked in . Of course , its holder can seek an exit through the bourses , as in the case of equity shareholders , where he may make profits or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rates for similar bonds are lower or higher , vis- ? -vis the bond he is holding , among other things . It has , but accoutrements of equity , in the sense that like equity , it is not redeemable , and hence a permanent source of finance for the issuer , which is why Basle-scarred banks have been lapping up the instrument with alacrity , with manufacturing and companies too getting into the act lately . The one-sided nature of the instrument would be apparent if one considers the take-it-or-leave-it features written into such bonds by the issuers . Some of the typical features are that the issuer may choose to call the bonds anytime , after say five years ; the issuer may choose to convert the bonds into shares and so on , with the holders of the bonds not having the put or indeed any other option . Despite the odds against the investors , perpetual bonds have been a huge hit with insurers and pension funds abroad , ever on the lookout for long-term avenues to park their funds , and wanting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which there is no reneging by the issuer . Tata Steel has already tapped the wholesale market in India for perpetual bonds denominated in rupees , and raised as much as Rs 1,500 crore and is gearing up for an overseas issue , its appetite having been sharpened . <h> BOOMING MARKET Quite a few other Indian companies are girding their loins to get into the bandwagon . The bonds do not strain the cash resources of the company , except at the time of payment of periodic interest , which is why from its standpoint , it is as good as equity . If anything , slightly better , because while raising of equity calls for an elaborate procedural and regulatory drill , a bond issue is much faster and relatively hassle-free . One might of course say , in the Indian context , equity would still be a better choice , especially if a company is lucky enough to make an IPO in a booming market , because it invariably walks away with a mind-boggling premium on which it does n't have to pay any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are n't any user charges either on the face value , because dividend is n't mandatory , but reputation-minded companies try to keep the investors in good humour.It is curious that the law speaks with a forked tongue on perpetual instruments . While equity conceptually and by definition is perpetual , the Companies Act , 1956 , does n't permit postponement of the denouement beyond twenty years , insofar as preference shares are concerned . In other words , not only ca n't companies in India issue irredeemable preference shares , but their redemption must happen within twenty years of their issue . This is as it should be , given the fact that an investor in preference shares gets only a marginally higher coupon rate vis- ? -vis bonds , but sans security , and it would have been advisedly better for him to put his money in bonds for a similar maturity . Be that as it may , Section 120 couched in legal jargon , has , in fact , been gathering dust till a clutch of Indian companies took heart from its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of it . It reads as follows : <h> LEGAL ASPECT "" A condition contained in any debentures , or in any deed for securing any debentures , whether issued or executed before or after the commencement of this Act , shall not be invalid by reason , only that thereby , the debentures are made irredeemable or redeemable only on the happening of a contingency , however remote , or on the expiration of a period , however long . "" Besides reeking of laboured drafting , the section is a complete retreat from Section 80 , which makes an all out effort to safeguard the interests of the preference shareholders when it comes to redemption . Retail investors should stay away from perpetual bonds , even if offered to them , because it simply is n't their cup of tea . In comparison , deep discount bonds emerge as a much better choice , because they call for a very low upfront investment , with the possibility of handing a bonanza over to generation next , on maturity , even though inflation , meanwhile , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other hand , putting money in perpetual bonds would mean denial of liquid resources to progeny , to get which they would be driven to entering the market , which is never free of minefields.","Class: , Family: , comment: , No risk, there aren't direct, immediate risks to Tata Steel that can be clearly identified from this particular news. The news mainly focuses on the success of Tata Steel in raising funds through perpetual bonds and their plans for further issues, without mentioning specific risks or challenges associated with this activity.

The Sule Square complex is located on land owned by the Quartermaster General Office of the country 's army ( officially known as Tatmadaw ) , which is tasked with securing supplies for its forces -- including , activists say , the bullets and artillery used to kill more than 700 civilians since the Feb. 1 coup . Colliers , which operates in Myanmar through an affiliate , has maintained its interest in the property despite years of efforts by United Nations experts to push foreign companies to sever ties with a military that has a long history of killing its own people , including Rohingya Muslims and anti-coup demonstrators . The Sule Square example also highlights gaps in Canada 's sanctions toward Myanmar , which are narrowly written and do not specifically cover the office of the Quartermaster General , despite a fresh warning on Tuesday in an advisory from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abroad , in any market or country , to respect human rights , operate lawfully , conduct their activities in a responsible manner and adopt voluntary best practices and internationally respected guidelines .

It describes "" the Quartermaster General Office-owned land leased to the Sule Shangri-La Hotel and Sule Square commercial project . "" The Quartermaster is "" the clearing point "" for procuring weapons and other supplies for the army , said Marzuki Darusman , the former attorney-general of Indonesia , who led the fact-finding mission . Foreigners are not allowed to own real estate in Myanmar , with only a few exceptions . The terms of any lease agreements on Sule Square are not known .

Additional incentives are also being created at the level of governments and associations .

Essentially , being a tax on imported products based on their carbon intensity , the mechanism is designed to prevent the so-called "" carbon leakage "" and to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is exactly the sort of cross-border carbon regulation that is going to become the main "" transit "" climate risk for Russian iron and steel companies , whose products are in high demand in Europe . According to various estimates , the amount of carbon tax for Russian manufacturers of semi-finished , rolled and finished products could reach ? 250-450mn annually . This will most likely be an additional reason for Russian metallurgists to start paying special attention to both low-carbon development projects and environmental , social and governance ( ESG ) risks in general . ESG Ranking of RAEX-Europe We released our first ESG ranking of the largest Russian companies back in 2018 . In the ranking , we assess the relevant ESG risks for companies and the mitigation of respective risks . Over the past year , our methodology for the assessment of companies has changed significantly : the number of analysed indicators has risen to more than 200 ( see Box 1 ) , and we have begun to take controversial situations and incidents ( controversies ) into consideration . Besides , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the verification of preliminary results in order to improve the quality of the assigned ratings . The expansion of the analytical base and the increase in the number of companies in the ranking allowed us to analyse the industry specifics in more detail as well as to start issuing industry rankings . The ranking of iron and steel companies presented in this article is the result of the analysis of ten largest Russian companies of the industry by revenue in 2019 ( see Box 2 ) . We have updated our ranking on a monthly basis , so it reflects occasional changes in the policies and procedures of the assessed companies , as well as the results of controversies monitoring . The plan is to expand the ranking further , as well as to update it , as the companies release their non-financial reports for 2020 . NLMK became the leader of our ranking ( see Table 1 ) , and made it into the top ten of our integrated ESG ranking of Russian companies , taking 4th place in the social category . NLMK demonstrates a high level of non-financial information disclosure in all the three areas of ESG . Moreover , the company has managed to significantly reduce specific and absolute figures of energy and water consumption in recent years . NLMK has also succeeded in meeting its ambitious workplace injuries targets : the company 's LTIFR has declined by 56% since 2013 . Also worth mentioning is the composition of NLMK 's board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the directors are independent . The reporting of Severstal , which is ranked second , also demonstrates a high level of transparency . The company pays significant attention to reducing environmental pollution and corporate social responsibility issues . Furthermore , Severstal received the highest industry score in the "" Human Capital "" category , which is based on the assessment of labour practices , occupational health and safety , recruitment practices and inclusivity . The Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works ( MMK ) rounds out the top three : the company has earned a high assessment of its business ethics practices and structure of the BoD . Sector specifics Due to the fact that the majority of the companies analysed are industry leaders , the distribution of companies by rating class is skewed towards higher scores . NLMK and Severstal are in the rating class , three companies are in the BBB class , two in the BB class , one company in the B , CCC and C classes ( medium and low ratings ) ( see Chart 1 ) . The companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ score for corporate governance practices ( 63 points out of 100 ) . However , the average score for the environmental performance of iron and steel companies ( 36 points ) is 2 points lower than that for oil and gas companies , whose updated ESG rating was published in January this year . At the same time , the average score for the social performance of iron and steel companies ( 49 points ) is 7 points higher than that of oil &amp; gas companies . Distribution of iron and steel companies by ESG rating The most problematic ESG factors with the lowest average scores include co-operation with suppliers on environmental and social issues , adaptation to climate change and renewable energy . If we talk about individual quantitative indicators , the intra-industry comparison is hampered , first of all , by the different level of disclosure of non-financial information in the sample . For example , a high-quality time series for workplace injuries can be extracted from the reports of only five companies ( NLMK , Severstal , Evraz , Metalloinvest and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down by about 20% from 2015 to 2019 . However , this figure is still 30% above the global industry average ( calculated by the World Steel Association based on the data from 104 steel companies ) ( see Chart 2 ) . Dynamics of the average LTIFR for the sample of Russian iron and steel companies and for the global sample of the World Steel Association Secondly , the comparison is made more difficult due to the differences of the companies in the sample , largely related to the presence or absence of a mining division . Nevertheless , based on the data of five companies from our sample , we observe positive industry dynamics for specific air emissions ( see Chart 3 ) and direct greenhouse gas ( GHG ) emissions ( Scope 1 , see Chart 4 ) . It is important to note that the level of disclosure of indirect GHG emissions ( Scope 2 ) among Russian iron and steel companies remains extremely low . We anticipate that in the future Russian iron and steel companies will improve the transparency of their non-financial indicators and as such will reduce the negative impact of their operations on the environment . The industry has significant decarburisation potential . Decisive and timely steps in this direction can reduce transit risks associated with European regulation and become a competitive advantage for the industry . Box 1 . Methodology reference : A company 's position in the Ranking is based on the score ( from 0 to 100 ) obtained as a part of the ESG rating assignment . Companies are ranked from those with the highest score ( "" leaders "" ) to those with the lowest score ( "" outsiders "" ) . The final score is a weighted average of the three components - E , S , and G sections . Each section includes two to four blocks , with weights set according to the industry . Figure 5 depicts the block weights for the iron and steel industry . In turn , each block consists of several thematic factors , in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company ( for example , a policy to reduce climate risks ) , reporting ( for example , the presence of annual CO2 emissions disclosure ) , as well as the company 's performance . In total , the current methodology uses over 200 quantitative and qualitative indicators and provides companies with an opportunity to comment on the preliminary results of the assessment and to send us additional information for the assessment . The full version of the methodology is available on the RAEX-Europe website . RAEX-Europe ( Rating-Agentur Expert RA GmbH ) is an independent European rating agency based in Frankfurt , officially registered by ESMA ( European Securities and Markets Authority ) with an ECAI ( External Credit Assessment Institution ) status . The Agency assigns classic credit ratings according to the international scale as well as non-credit ESG ratings .

Six EU sanctions packages followed , and over 200 foreign companies exited the Russian market . But the EU is not the only destination for Russian goods and services . The Global South accounts for 80% of the world 's population and just over half of global GDP . Russia is an established player there , and Russian companies have proved quick on the draw in re-directing their Europe-bound trade to the South . Alexey Miller , CEO of state-owned gas giant Gazprom , told executives and politicians at the St Petersburg International Economic Forum ( SPIEF ) that the company had increased its gas exports to China by almost 70% in the first five months of 2022 when compared with the same period the previous year . China has accounted for 32% of the growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to RIA Novosti , so is a key strategic market for gas providers . With Chinese gas demand growing by an average 22bn cubic metres a year for the past five years , Russia 's pivot to China is only set to accelerate . Meanwhile , China and India have overtaken Germany as the biggest buyers of Russian crude oil . Russia exported a record 8.42mn tonnes of discounted crude oil to China in May -- almost 2mn barrels per day ( bpd ) , which is an increase of 28% relative to April . Russia said last month it expects up to RUB1 trillion ( $14.4bn ) in additional oil and gas revenues in 2022 . India and China between them are purchasing enough Russian oil to compensate for the loss in western custom . The phenomenon is not limited to energy giants . Russian companies across the board have been redirecting trade flows in response to dwindling import demand in Europe . China is one of the most significant new markets for Russian business . Russian trade with its southeastern neighbour grew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , according to data published by Chinese customs . China and Russia hope to grow that figure further -- to a whopping $200bn per year by the end of 2024 . Russia 's metallurgical companies turned to China after Europe banned imports of Russian steel slab . Fastmarkets reports that Russia exported 1.3mn tonnes of steel slab to European countries in 2020 . With this market gone , steel companies Severstal , NLMK and Evraz re-directed exports to emerging markets . The 400,000 tonnes of semi-finished steel products sent to China by the three companies in the second half of April exceeded the amount exported to China in the whole of 2021 by more than five times . By selling their products at a significant discount relative to the other regional steel producers ( such as Malaysia and Indonesia ) , the Russian companies hope to establish a foothold in the Chinese market and cultivate relationships with new clients . Petrochemicals manufacturer Sibur provides another striking example . More than 20% of Sibur 's products used to be exported to Europe , which was the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went primarily to Eastern Europe , France , Germany and the Netherlands . Now , the share of Sibur 's sales going to Russia 's western neighbours has been reduced almost to zero , while its Asian exports have ballooned . Forced to re-shape its trade flows , the company now plans to increase exports to Asia significantly this year . The company will most likely return to the market if sanctions are lifted , but for now some European companies will not be receiving products from Sibur . Meanwhile , European imports of synthetic rubber and polymers from Russia have dropped steeply , as have some of the components needed to manufacture them such as naphtha and LPG . Analysts are predicting shortages of both goods unless European companies can find new suppliers to make up the shortfall , but specialist materials like these can be notoriously difficult to source at short notice . Sibur 's case is a particularly effective litmus test because the company has not been sanctioned . It is therefore a useful indication of the general flow of Russian goods away from Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ahead of the curve here , as it has been working with China for more than 10 years , allowing it to adapt more quickly than other Russian companies . The Chinese direction was set by former CEO Dmitry Konov , who left the company this year amid Western sanctions against Russian officials and businessmen . Educated in Switzerland , Konov has a reputation for striking up foreign partnerships and championing an outward-looking management style . His strategy of increasing resilience by orientating trade flows towards developing markets has proved very perceptive . If Sibur is indeed an early indicator , and other Russian companies follow its pivot to the Global South , the implications for world trade could be significant . Speaking at a business forum of leaders from BRICS countries in June ( Brazil , Russia , India , China and South Africa ) , Russian President Vladimir Putin said that "" Russian business circles are activating their contacts with the business communities of the BRICS countries ... The volumes of Russian oil delivered to China and India are growing noticeably . Collaboration in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significant volumes of fertilisers to BRICS states . Russian IT companies are expanding their activities in India and South Africa ... "" As Russian producers forge new trading partnerships and strengthen existing ones , business confidence in June reached its highest level since February . Activity in Russia 's manufacturing sector also began expanding again last month . Where next ? There can be no question that European sanctions are contributing to adverse effects on the Russian economy , and a deep recession is on the way . Russia 's Ministry of Economic Development estimated that growth was down 4.3% in May 2022 . And transactions through the Central Bank of Russia 's payments system were down 7.2% in June compared with the previous quarter -- a reliable sign of economic decline . But it is also clear that Russian companies are flexible enough to look for new trading partners , and that many of them have long been geared up to do just that . On the other hand , European industry is looking increasingly anaemic without the supplies of Russian raw materials which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world 's largest importer of natural gas , and some very industrialised countries such as Germany rely heavily on Russian commodities for their export-based economic model . With benchmark European gas prices around five times higher than they were a year ago , Europe is reeling . The shock has contributed to a steady devaluation of the euro , which is now at its weakest level in twenty years . WTO forecasts for merchandise trade volumes in 2022-3 show "" Europe is now expected to underperform on the import side "" . The continent is set to experience shortages of some of the raw materials and consumables provided chiefly by Russia , including grain , energy and rare metals like palladium . European companies must now show that they are as resilient as their Russian counterparts , which are forging new partnerships and entering new markets . Africa could be an invaluable partner in this undertaking . Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi has signed a new gas supply deal with Algeria to increase gas imports by around 40% . And British energy giant BP is looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gap created when it left the Russian gas market . West African LNG supplier Nigeria LNG is looking to boost gas production from the end of the year in order to help meet increased demand from the likes of France and Portugal . The Middle East will be another important player in the bid to wean Europe off Russian commodities . US President Joe Biden recently returned from a visit to the region , ostensibly hoping to improve trading relations with Saudi Arabia as well as to promote the US ' geopolitical objectives . In an article for the Washington Post , Biden wrote that he was going to the Middle East because the region 's "" energy resources are vital for mitigating the impact on global supplies of Russia 's war in Ukraine . "" Biden added that Saudi officials are "" working with my experts to help stabilise oil markets with other OPEC producers . "" Qatar , which currently supplies around 30% of its gas to the European Union , has so far been the only Gulf state to indicate that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover the shortfall . But much more can be done . Israel alone could provide Europe with 10% of the gas currently coming from Russia . The Middle East 's steel market , meanwhile , can churn out about 16 times the annual volume formerly supplied to the EU by Russia . Russian industry has shown that the decline in trade relations between Russia and Europe need not be a death knell . European companies must demonstrate the same versatility if the West is to successfully re-orientate its model of trade .","Class: Financial, Family: Economic Outlook, comment: Stagnation, EU sanction and Ukrain War

As a result , **31;102;TOOLONG ( ESG ) triad is becoming an increasingly topical issue in Russia . The pace of development in this sector is phenomenal . In recent months only , a considerable number of events have occurred that form the basis of ESG in Russia . For you to be always up to date with the current trends , the Moscow Office of Herbert Smith Freehills has launched regular publications of ESG Updates . This update is a summary of the most essential regulatory/policy changes and market developments in the field of ESG in Russia . Our firm has been advising on ESG issues for over 30 years and is deeply involved in this topic . Among other things , Herbert Smith Freehills maintains the ESG Hub to post ESG materials drawn up by our offices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initial version of the Draft Law , which we covered earlier in one of our publications , the new one allows holding the experiment not only in the Sakhalin region but also in others . The experiment expansion in terms of territory is expected to require amendments to the federal law to be adopted pursuant to the Draft Law . In addition to the Sakhalin region , there are at least four Russian regions interested in participating in the experimenti . To recap , the Federal Law "" On Limiting GHG Emissions "" ( the GHG Law ) took effect in December 2021 . Among other things , it introduced carbon reporting and established a legal framework for the trading of carbon units ( the units verify the implementation of voluntary climate projects to reduce carbon footprint ) . According to the draftsman , the GHG Law sets an example of "" soft "" regulation , while the Draft Law provides for tougher measures . They refer to setting up the GHG emissions quota system . Emitters will be charged a fee if the quota is exceeded and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than quoted . The fee will be established by the Russian Government . According to public sourcesii , it will be calculated with reference to the average global price of emissions and the average quota price in the EU ETS . The fee is expected to be remitted to the relevant regional budget and spent on activities for reduction of GHG emissions and increase of their absorption , as well as related R&amp;D efforts . Credits may be traded freely alongside the carbon units covered by the GHG Law . The amount of the quotas will be approved on a regional level , taking into account public debate . Some representatives of the business community have reacted to the introduction of the quota system negatively , insist on abandoning it and propose not to expand the experiment to the other territories , until the Sakhalin experiment demonstrates unbiased positive outcomes . Among other things , enterprises operating in certain sectors ( e.g. gas infrastructure development , low carbon hydrogen production ) are proposed to be excluded from the experiment . The business also asks for tax benefits to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian Ministry of Economic Development commented on the remarks of the business by stating that introducing quotas on emissions and charging a fee for exceeding the quotas are the key elements of the experimentiii . The introduction of quotas is particularly important in the context of the carbon border tax expected to be introduced in the EU ( the CBAM ) . The creation of a national emissions quota system may potentially allow to decrease the CBAM burden for Russian exporters . CBAM adverse effect may turn out to be quite far-reaching for Russian companies . Thus , according to the chairman of the board of directors of a major Russian iron and steel producer , PJSC Severstal , the annual damage to the company will amount to approximately USD 70 million per yeariv , and , as estimated by the first deputy prime minister of the Russian Government , the ? BAM is capable of effectively blocking access to the European market of mineral fertilizersv . International cooperation The Russian Ministry of Economic Development is currently negotiating the mutual recognition and set-off of carbon units with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overview ) , the parties agreed on the possibility for the mutual recognition of carbon units upon reaching the relevant bilateral agreements . Cooperation with these countries , in the first place , is primarily accounted for by their interest in Sakhalin projects . The representative of the Russian Ministry of Economic Development clarified that , in addition to Japan and Singapore , negotiations at the EAEU level are expected to be heldvi . Incentives for investment in reducing carbon dioxide emissions Experts of the Centre for Strategic Research1 ( the CSR ) have elaborated a set of exemptions and benefits for the business . According to CSR experts , to boost investment in reducing carbon dioxide emissions it is necessary to introduce an investment tax deduction or depreciation allowance on the profits tax for the integration of low and zero carbon technologies , as well as for the use of secondary energy resources ( SER ) in the production of goods . In addition to motivation for the business , incentive measures for individuals are proposed to be taken . For example , the introduction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other forms of targeted financial supportvii . Carbon dioxide capture and sequestration projects Russian companies consider investment in carbon dioxide capture and storage ( CCS ) projects . The ? ? S basically is a process of flooding carbon dioxide into an underground tank or subsurface which prevent its discharge to the surface . Such technology is already used for climate purposes abroad , specifically , in the US . In December 2021 , Gazprom neft was reported to have announced its plans to invest RUB 30 billion in the CCS project in the Orenburg region . At the first stage , the amount of about 1 Mtpa CO2 is expected to be pumpedviii . NOVATEK and Tatneft had also made public announcements on the proposed implementation of similar projects earlierix . Currently , there are neither ongoing CCS projects nor relevant regulations in Russia . The implementation of such projects involves significant costs , which may necessitate governmental support measures . HYDROGEN Low carbon hydrogen energy program According to public sources , the Russian Ministry of Energy has drawn up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be potentially extended up to 2050 . The document has not been made public yet . The program explores four cases for the development of both "" blue "" and "" green "" hydrogen production and exports . Pursuant to the base case , hydrogen exports will amount to about 12 Mtpa by 2050 . The amount of proposed investment in the program is expected to be USD 26 billion , of which USD 9 billion constitute the national support funds for the creation of the logistics infrastructure . The Russian Ministry of Energy mentions ten most crucial hydrogen export pilot projects , including the projects of such companies , as NOVATEK and Rosatom . The program indicates risks which may affect the achievement of targeted outcomes , such as the fall in prices caused by large-scale projects in Saudi Arabiax . Exports of Russian hydrogen NOVATEK has become the first Russian company to enter into the export contract regarding the main conditions of long-term supplies of low carbon ammonia in industrial-scale volumes . It refers to annual supplies of 1.2 Mtpa of blue ammonia from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SE . Ammonia will be transformed into hydrogen by the purchaser , as the transportation of pure hydrogen is expensive and dangerous . German-based RWE and Japan-based Mitsui may become other potential purchasers of NOVATEKxi . In the very end of November 2021 , the Russian president instructed the Russian Government and Gazprom to explore the possibility of exporting hydrogen to Europe in the form of methane-hydrogen mixture via the existing pipelinesxii . Previously , the production of hydrogen at the location of its consumption had been viewed as preferable . There is a view that Nord Stream 2 might be used for hydrogen transportationxiii . In mid-December 2021 , the European Commission prepared a number of legislative proposals to ensure energy safety of the European Union and gas market decarbonisation , including in respect of the hydrogen market regulation . One of the main aims is to establish a market for hydrogen , create the right environment for investment , and enable the development of dedicated infrastructure , including for trade with third countries . The market rules will cover such issues as access to hydrogen infrastructures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tariff settingxiv . The low carbon gas market will be potentially regulated by the same rules as the gas market , i.e. pursuant to the EU Third Energy Package . Hydrogen and metallurgy Global steel company NLMK Group andRusatom Overseas ( part of Rosatom group ) signed an agreement on cooperation in hydrogen production and development of CCS technologies . Among other things , the agreement provides for joint research in hydrogen technologies , as well as the implementation of pilot projects . NLMK treats the use of low carbon hydrogen as one of prospective areas of the metals industry developmentxv . Hydrogen and nuclear power The first Russian nuclear power plant which energy is expected to be used for hydrogen production may start operating in Russia as early as in 2036 . This is a project of Rosatom group . The development of the conceptual design of a high-temperature gas-cooled reactor ( HTGCR ) is being currently completed , and the engineering design of the HTGCR unit is scheduled to be finalised by 2023xvi . Most likely , it is the pilot project based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Exchange registered the first issue of transition bonds On 17 December 2021 , the Moscow Exchange for the first time registered a bond loan compliant with the transition bondsprinciples and adaptation financial instrumentcriteria . The issuer of such bonds is INK-Capital . Cash proceeds from the issue of transition bonds are expected to be used for refinancing of the project aimed at the disposal of APG that used to be flaredxviii . On 14 December 2021 , a meeting of the Public Council of the Russian Ministry of Energy was held to discuss the issue of RES development in Russia . At the meeting , the minister of energy proposed discontinuing additional RES support after 2035 once the prices for RES and traditional generation become equal . It is anticipated that in such case this support will be unnecessary . By that time , investors are expected to be able to build green plants on their ownxix . ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION Law on the elimination of accumulated harm to the environment The bill we had dealt with in detail in the previous overview became a law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except for certain provisions . Trend of tightening the environmental policy On 14 December 2021 , the Russian Government held a meeting to consider a number of significant items on the Russian environmental agenda . In particular , the issues of implementing the Clean Air federal project were brought up . To recap , its implementation entails , among other things , the reduction -- by at least 20% -- of the aggregate emissions of pollutants into the atmosphere in the most contaminated cities by the end of 2024 . Pursuant to the Federal Law "" On Holding the Experiment of Quoting Emissions of Pollutants "" adopted in furtherance of the federal project , emission limits ( which take into account the emission targets ) shall be set for the sources of air pollutants in the cities where the experiment is conducted . Where such quotas can not be complied with , enterprises shall elaborate and carry out the relevant activities to reduce emissions . It was noted at the meeting that industrial enterprises are reluctant to perform their experiment-related duties . Instructions were issued to extend the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a failure to meet the quotas are proposed to be introduced . Among other things , the problematic issues of implementing the transition of enterprises to the best available techniques ( BATs ) were discussed . The reform is intended to improve environmental friendliness of production facilities through the integration of best practices reflected in BAT reference books . The transition to BATs is encouraged , while the refusal to use them is , on the contrary , subject to certain sanctions ( such as the need to pay increased environmental fees ) . However , the existing BATs were repeatedly criticised for being too soft , inefficient and significantly lagging behind not only EU standards but even standards that used to be in place in Russia before . Thus , during the meeting the deputy prime minister asked the Russian president to bring the rules of the BAT technology reference book "" Fuel combustion at major units for energy generation purposes "" into compliance with the 1995 state standard . As a result of the meeting , the Russian president agreed to notably strengthen liability of company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ updating the BAT reference book on fuel combustionxx . Liability for breaching the requirements for the prevention of oil product spills A law imposing liability for breaching the requirements for the prevention and elimination of oil and oil product spills was adopted . The law envisages fines of up to RUB 500,000 , and a repeated breach may threaten companies with the suspension of their activities for up to three months . The new regulation will take effect from 2022 . The requirements for the prevention and elimination of oil and oil product spills have been introduced in response to the large-scale oil spill through the fault of Norilsk Nickel . The company was ordered by the court to reimburse RUB 146 bln ( app . USD 2 bln ) in damages .

317,@@97210910,2023,ArcelorMittal,"With an abundance of sun and wind , Spain is positioning itself as Europe 's future leader in green hydrogen production to clean up heavy industries . But some energy sector experts express caution over ramping up an industry that would be wholly reliant on massive increases in the availability of zero-carbon electricity . Ecological transition minister Teresa Ribera hosted a major conference earlier this month for global renewable energy players . It focused on measures "" to guarantee our energy security "" as the European Union refocuses on intra-bloc supply chains for its energy needs . The Spanish government announced a Hydrogen Roadmap in 2020 , but the sector has taken on greater importance in Europe since Russia 's invasion of Ukraine . Russia is the world 's second-largest producer of natural gas , which powers most global hydrogen production . The International Energy Agency said in December that Spain would account for half of Europe 's growth in dedicated renewable capacity for hydrogen production . Green hydrogen is created when renewable energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separating its hydrogen and oxygen molecules through electrolysis . The process does n't produce planet-warming carbon dioxide , but less than 0.1% of global hydrogen production is currently created in this way , according to the IEA . The separated hydrogen can be used in the production of steel , ammonia and chemical products , all of which require industrial processes that are harder to wean off fossil fuels . Hydrogen can also be used as a transportation fuel , which could one day transform the highly polluting shipping and aviation sectors . "" Renewable energy , including renewable hydrogen , is a central pillar of the REPowerEU Plan , which is the EU 's strategy to get rid of Russian fossil fuels as soon as possible , "" said EU Commissioner for Energy , Kadri Simson , in an email . Spain already has 15.5 gigawatts of electrolyzer capacity earmarked for green hydrogen , far higher than the target of four gigawatts set out in the roadmap for 2030 . Spain 's large , windswept and sparsely populated territory receives more than 2,500 hours of sunshine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agency , providing ideal conditions for wind and solar energy , and therefore green hydrogen production . "" If you look at where hydrogen is going to be produced in Europe in the next million years , it 's in two countries , Spain and Portugal , "" said Thierry Lepercq , the founder and president of HyDeal Ambition , an industry platform bringing together 30 companies . "" Hydrogen is the new oil . "" Lepercq is working with companies like Spanish gas pipeline corporation Enagas and global steel giant ArcelorMittal to design an end-to-end model for hydrogen production , distribution and supply at a competitive price . Criticism has centered on green hydrogen 's higher cost compared with highly-polluting "" gray hydrogen "" drawn from natural gas . Lepercq argues that solar energy produced in Spain is priced low enough to compete . While cars and heating solutions for buildings are increasingly electric , other sectors are harder to crack . Globally , Lepercq said , "" Electricity , power , is 20% of energy consumption . What about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replace those fossil fuels . Not in 50 years time . You need to replace them now . "" HyDeal aims to replace high-emitting processes like using coking coal and blast furnaces in steel manufacturing , and natural gas in ammonia production for fertilizers . It must first build solar farms and electrolyzers in northern Spain , joining other green hydrogen plants recently inaugurated in central Spain and Mallorca . The European Commission has proposed that the bloc produce 10 million metric tons of renewable hydrogen by 2030 and to import 10 million metric tons more . Hydrogen consumption in Spain is currently around 500,000 metric tons per year , mainly produced from natural gas and used in refineries and chemical production . By 2030 , the EU is attempting to cut emissions in the bloc by 55% compared to 1990 levels . Spain , France , Germany and Portugal have agreed to build a hydrogen pipeline by 2030 to transport some 2 million metric tons of hydrogen to France annually -- 10% of the EU 's estimated hydrogen needs . Hydrogen presents challenges for transportation as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ribera , the Spanish minister , knows green hydrogen requires an upfront investment that will only pay off in the long term .

The index uses the value of their company shares and other metrics to calculate the wealth of Russia 's top businessmen , and despite the extreme sanctions imposed on Russia following the invasion of Ukraine just over a year ago , the Russian stock market has shown some signs of life recently . The dollar-denominated RTS Russia index broke through the psychologically important 1,000 mark last week -- a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sanctions imposed in 2014 following the annexation of Crimea . ( chart ) But the market began to boom again from about 2000 onwards as a four-year recession came to an end and foreign investors enthusiastically piled back into the Russian equity market . In 2021 alone there were a dozen Russian IPOs that raised billions of dollars , and another 24 companies were in the IPO pipeline for 2022 . The RTS hit a two-decade-long peak of 1,934 on October 26 , a week before the US State Department gave a press conference warning that Russia could invade Ukraine "" any day now "" that sent the stock market into a tailspin . Likewise , the ruble-denominated MOEX Russia Index reached an all-time high of 4,292.68 in October of 2021 , before following the RTS down into the abyss .

However , Russian domestic investors are still actively buying and selling stocks and the market is open to investors from "" friendly "" countries , some of whom have been bottom fishing in the last year . Oligarch wealth As bne IntelliNews has reported , after the initial shocks of sanctions passed , Russia 's economy has started to stabilise again and that has put money back into the pockets of the oligarchs . One of the factors that has reignited the interest of investors is that many of Russia 's blue chip companies feel comfortable enough to restart paying dividends ; for several years Russia 's leading corporations have been paying the most generous dividends in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emerging Markets average . The founder and majority owner of Russia 's biggest privately owned oil company Lukoil , Vagit Alekperov , has earned the most , after he added $3.17bn in just the last two months , bringing his fortune up to $18.5bn , according to Bloomberg 's calculations . In second place is his peer , Leonid Mikhelson , who owns Russia 's LNG champion Novatek and who also has made $1.65bn in eight weeks , and his fortune now stands at $26.3bn , according to the index , thanks to the valuation appreciation of his stocks . Since the beginning of the year , Vladimir Lisin , chairman of the board of directors of NLMK and several times ranked as Russia 's richest man , has earned $1.17bn , raising his net worth to $21bn . Meanwhile , the fortune of banking and fertiliser tycoon Andrey Melnichenko , who exited his cash cow EuroChem after he was sanctioned , saw his wealth fall by $571mn to $12.6bn .

Russian investment bank BCS just upgraded the Russian equity market to a "" buy "" with a 45% upside for 2023 , the bank said in a note on March 27 , which will collectively earn the oligarchs tens of billions of dollars more if it happens .

When steel prices turn volatile , Tata Steel 's Indian operations have a distinct edge . They are highly efficient , enjoy high margins due to product mix and have captive mines . Capacity-additions underway in the Indian market will lift Tata Steel 's consolidated margins . Tata Steel 's stock trades at Rs 476 , discounting the trailing 12-month earnings by 6.4 times and is cheap compared to domestic peers such as SAIL ( 10.7 times ) and JSW Steel ( seven times ) . On an enterprise value basis , Tata Steel at 5.5 times FY-11 EBDITA ( earnings before interest , depreciation and taxes ) trades at a discount to global peers such as Arcelor Mittal , POSCO and Nippon Steel . <h> DOMESTIC ADVANTAGE Tata Steel operates in three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian operations enjoy two advantages : One , making steel using captive mines is currently far more profitable than the model based on buying raw materials from external miners . Two , Indian markets offer far greater potential on steel demand and are more resilient in terms of demand than the UK , the Netherlands and South-East Asian markets . Despite lower growth in several consumer segments and lacklustre infrastructure spending , Indian steel production grew by five per cent in the first seven months of 2011 . During the first quarter of the ongoing fiscal , Tata Steel 's net sales rose by 22 per cent to Rs 33,000 crore on the back of higher realisations and marginally higher deliveries . EBIDTA , excluding ' other income ' , dipped marginally to Rs 4,400 crore due to higher raw material costs . But they still fared better than domestic and international steel makers . This number may have been worse if it were not for the Indian operations , whose EBIDTA increased six per cent to Rs 3,100 crore . Indian operations chipped in with 70 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a third of the company 's steel . This was topped off by healthy realisations . In the quarter ended June 2011 , Tata Steel 's Indian operations earned Rs 20,000 in operating profits per tonne of steel compared to Rs 3,500 from its European operations . This tear-away advantage is difficult to overstate and remains the key catalyst for Tata Steel 's stock over the next five years . <h> EXPANSION IN INDIA The company 's Jamshedpur unit is in the process of upping its annual steel production capacity from 6.8 million tpa to 9.7 million tpa , benefits of which are expected to kick-in from FY-13 . Captive mines will take care of the entire iron ore requirement for this expansion and half the coking coal requirement . A three-million tpa flat-products plant in Orissa is also to be commissioned by 2014 . The company is in the process of tying up iron ore reserves and coal mines for this plant .

40,@@4203489,2011,Posco,"On June 24th , 2011 , there was no ' good ' in the ' morning ' for me . As soon as I opened the Newspaper , a photograph of two old men appeared in front of me , which seems that they were crying endlessly . I was shocked to see their ugly faces . They are resident of Dhinkiya village situated in Jagadshingpur district of Odisha . Perhaps , they have been living in the vicinity before existence of the Indian state . Indeed , both of them had witnessed the formation of Indian State , which had promised them for the land reforms , elimination of poverty , illiteracy and inequality . Apart from that there was a promise to address the issues of food , clothing and shelter . However , the tide turned ; the 64 years of Indian independence has added more pains , sufferings and sorrows in the lives of majority of its people . The Indian state instead of healing the pains , sufferings and sorrows of the old-men , it turned their lives into a hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ' mighty state ' with the barrel of guns in the name of growth and development . The state claims that they were given compensation for their lands and betel vines . However , in these circumstances , the compensation is not an issue for them at all , but what matters is ; they have lost the only heritage they had . They have lost their livelihood resources , which would have sustained their generations and can not be exchanged with the money as they are not much habituated to work with the market economy . They cry because their lands were taken away forcefully from them and handed over to a Korean company POSCO . However , the Odisha government claims that it has acquired the land without use of force , which is entirely false . I recall that when I was studying , we were taught in the schools that ' India is a country of villages ' , ' agriculture is backbone of the country ' and ' the soul of India lives in the villages ' . The Indian state has been going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the farmers of POSCO project area rely on betel , fish and paddy for their food security and social security . However , the state government deployed the police and paramilitary forces for destroying the betel vines . According to the Odisha government , there were about 1800 betel vines and about 650 betel vines were already destroyed by the forces and villages are about to be vacated . "" We plan to remove the rest in the coming weeks , "" claims Paradeep 's additional district magistrate Sarojkanta Chaoudhury . The billion dollar question is can any country destroy its backbone , heritage and abode of its soul ? Needless to say that the Odisha government has been attempting to acquire 3719 acres of land for the Korean company POSCO , which had signed a MoU with the Odisha government for establishing 12 Mt steel plant near Paradeep in Jagadsinghpur district . It is the biggest Foreign Direct Investment ( FDI ) in the country with the proposed investment of Rs. 51,000 crore . Therefore , one can understand about the madness of the Odisha government for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adivasis and other forest dwellers as none existing in the project area though these people have been living in the vicinity for generations . The most interesting thing is the MoU of the POSCO has expired a year back and the government did n't renewal it yet but the land acquisition process has been in rampant . The Orissa government is ready to go to any extend for the POSCO project . It has already acquired 1800 acres of land of the total requirement of 3719 acres . The work for rehabilitation colony has already started and the government is confident of acquiring the required land without use of force . The villagers have been protesting against the land acquisition for the POSCO since 2005 . However , the resistance intensified recently , when the whole state machinery was engaged in land acquisition process . There is some unique in the mass movement . These villagers are not only protesting but also building up some betel vine , which were destroyed by the police forces . "" We have started rebuilding betel Vines that the administration pulled down , "" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . The men , women and children are protesting endlessly against the land acquisition against the mighty state and corporate house . Consequently , the prohibitory order under IPC section 144 was also imposed in the project area so that the agitators can be stopped to enter into the vicinity and land acquisition process can be done after destroying the betel vines . Another interesting factor is when the rights are to be recognized under the Forest Rights Act 2006 , the Adivasis and local settlers were made non-existence and some of them were also brought under the purview of ' encroachers ' . However , when the lands and forest have to be given to the corporate shark POSCO , neither the environment nor the livelihood and social security makes sense for the state . What a lovely democratic system of governance we have in our country . Interestingly , when the government failed to acquire land even after use of the police and paramilitary forces , it started threatening to the activists and villagers , using the tool of child rights . Since , more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agitation ; the Odisha government suddenly woke up to see the violation of child rights in the protest . The Women and Child Development Minister , Anjali Behera sought a report from the district social welfare officer about the children . She said , "" The DSWO will verify whether the children came to the agitation on their own or were forced into it "" . "" We will take action against the persons responsible for misusing children . Civil society will never tolerate use of children below 18 years of age in any agitation , "" she added . Ironically , the same government does not see any violation of the child rights by the corporate sharks or the state law enforcement agencies , who are constantly attempting to snatch away the land and livelihood resources of the villagers , which will have direct impact on children . When the parents lose their land and livelihood resources , how can children be sent to schools ? Why should not the Odisha government respond it and so the centre ? What kind of civil society is this ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Samajwadi Party and Forward Block . However , the most stunning factor is the support of the BJP and the Congress Party to the agitation . The BJP is a party of the business men and its track record in the BJP rule states is obvious and the Congress is playing a double standards . The Union minister gives environment clearance on the one hand and also opposes the project on the other ? The Environment minister , Jairam Ramesh , who gave the environment clearance to POSCO in January this year said , "" However , I hope that the state government will not use this clearance as a license for forcible acquisition of land . "" What does it mean ? And of course , one should ask that why the soldier of Adivasis , Rahul Gandhi is silent on the issue of POSCO ? In fact , both the center and state governments want the land for POSCO at any cost therefore one should not be overwhelmed after seeing halt to land acquisition for the time being . The Chief Secretary of Orissa BK Patnaik said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proposed plant site area near Paradip should not be considered as a ' deadlock over the POSCO Project . "" Obviously , the whole state machinery is working in the support of the POSCO Company . Has the POSCO bought the Odisha government ? The state of Odisha has established itself as an emerging industrialized state and it has signed 90 MoUs with the corporate houses including POSCO , Vedanta and Tata Steel . The most important question is whether the industrialization process is addressing the issues of malnutrition , poverty , illiteracy , ill-health and inequality of Odisha as the father of the modern India Nehru had envisages the outcome of industrialization ? If the answer is "" no "" then we must stop the industrialization process immediately because we can not allow the state to grab the land and livelihood resources of the villagers and hand over those to the corporate sharks in the name of growth and development . Of course , today , it 's not the issue whether the land owners were given compensation in local or the market rate of their land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the landowners into the landless in the country which had promised to give land to the tillers and landless . If it continues , the Adivasis and local land owners will become landless and the corporate will become the landlords . We should not allow the state to handover the ' land to the corporate ' against the promise of ' land to the tillers ' . Do we want to make India as a corporate state ? Then the questions come into one 's mind are what should we do with the mineral resources ? Should we let it lie beneath the land and also leave those in the mountains ? If we want to address the issues of conflict on the issues of land , territory and resource , we must rethink on the present model of development . Our model of development should not be based on minerals only but it should be based on agro-forest , supported by horticulture and animal husbandry . And wherever there is a requirement of minerals , the community mining should be encouraged . Have you seen any farmer in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Litchis ? If the farmers sell the fruits not the trees then why the Adivasis and other land owners are asked to sell their lands to the mining companies instead of minerals ? Why do n't we ask them to sell the minerals to the companies and let the land be with them forever ? The tears of two old-men of Odisha is enough to remind the Indian state about its broken promises and alarms it against the forcefully acquisition of the resources from the tillers and handing over to the corporate sharks . If it continues , the inequality , discontent and extremism will grow . And of course , there would be results as a ' civil war ' and one should only blame for it to the Indian state that made its people cry .

Within two to three years , says the group 's chairman , Ratan Tata , the company will launch a vamped-up , slightly wider version of the Nano in the United States , fitted with modern safety features such as an advanced braking system . An electric version may come even sooner . ' ' It will be a full car , ' ' Tata says . ' ' US$7000 is still an attractive price . ' ' While bringing compact size and value to mature Western markets , Tata is also taking luxury motoring east . It is discussing a joint venture to manufacture Jaguar sedans and Range Rover SUVs in China , already the second-biggest market for these top-end brands acquired from Ford four years ago . But the ability to think small may turn out to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the biggest business groups in a country destined to be among the biggest forces in the global economy . Indeed , thinking small is helping the whole country leap ahead , as in the ultra-cheap packages that have put mobile phones in the hands of small farmers and street peddlers , and the newly-developed $35 tablet computer , the Akaash ( meaning ' ' sky ' ' ) , that the government plans to hand out to school students . Bringing his baby , the Nano , into the world has been a fraught process , however , as Ratan Tata outlined in a talk with the Sydney Morning Herald in his office at Bombay House , headquarters of the group founded by his great-great-grandfather , Jamshedji Tata , in 1868 . When announced in 2008 , the Nano created a worldwide buzz of anticipation . With pared-down design and powered by a 624cc motor , the car promised comfortable driving at a base price of one lakh ( 100,000 ) rupees ( then about US$2500 ) , immediately bridging the gap between the scooters on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then the troubles started . The factory site Tata had negotiated with the then Marxist government in West Bengal state was hit with local unrest stirred by the then opposition leader , Mamata Bannerjee , alleging the land had been stolen from local farmers for inadequate compensation . With the plant 85 per cent completed , the campaign got very nasty . The compound walls were repeatedly broken down , construction steel looted , and workers beaten up by hired toughs . ' ' Weeks away from delivering the first car , we decided to pull out , ' ' Tata said . In a midnight operation , the company packed up the dies and tools for the Nano and drove them out . ' ' The same people who had tried to stop us setting up then tried to stop us leaving , ' ' Tata said . Production was shifted to a new site in Gujarat , the state on on the opposite side of India noted for its pro-industry government , but a year was lost . Interest in the first run of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orders , and ran a lottery to prioritise deliveries . Then a new problem emerged : a series of seemingly spontaneous fires in Nano cars as they were running - only seven cases of the 100,000 , but setting off a bout of negative publicity . A puzzled and worried Tata acquired all seven burnt-out cars and brought them back for forensic examination by British experts trained by Scotland Yard . In five of the cases , Tata said , the forensic specialists found traces of oily rags placed on the catalytic converters in the exhaust systems , parts that heat to 600 degrees centigrade and where a piece of cloth would be certain to generate fires that would engulf fuel lines . Who would want to sabotage the Nano launch is unclear , as there is still no direct competitor in the Indian market , but the fires have stopped , and Tata have cleared up other small technical faults . Sales that dipped to a low of 500 a month are now back between 9000 and 10,000 cars a month . The company is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' the poor man 's car ' ' - a turn-off to aspirational buyers . Indeed , it is not uncommon in Mumbai to see owners sitting in the back seat , with a chauffeur at the wheel . Consolidating the Nano 's place in the market will be one of the final tasks for Ratan Tata as he prepares to hand over the chairmanship of Tata Sons , the holding company , next year when he turns 75 . His successor is Cyrus Mistry , 43 , who is already a director , by virtue of the 18.4 per cent stake built up by his father , the founder of the Shapoorji Pallonji construction group . Although not a Tata , the younger Mistry belongs to the same religious community of Parsis , descended from Zoroastrians who fled Persia more than a thousand years ago . With a smile , Tata says he is a victim of the retirement policies he himself introduced when he took over as chairman and chief executive from his 90-year-old uncle , the late J.R.D. Tata , in 1991 . That came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1971 , pursuing a joint venture with former wool broker Dalgety 's . Ratan Tata took over as India was making a decisive switch from command economics to market-based policies , creating an environment for which India 's leading business house suddenly looked woefully handicapped . As a result of previous government policies designed to limit corporate power and market share , business operations were spread over dozens of group companies in wildly diverse sectors , many making little or no profit . The parent company 's equity was generally so low the group chairman relied as much on the persuasive powers of the Tata name , renowned across India for ethical practices and sober management , as on his voting power . Ratan Tata recognised the group needed to concentrate on its more profitable activities , and deepen the Tata brand . But he faced an elderly board , some of whom used to nod off in meetings , as well as long-entrenched satraps running group companies . ' ' The reaction was that we have been doing it this way for over 100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recalled . His answer , helping to unlock change , was an official retirement policy at age 65 for executive directors and 75 for non-executive directors . Today Tata runs a more focused group that has grown from combined revenue of US$5 billion in 1991 to an expected US$100 billion in the current year ending March 31 . The mainstay businesses are the software arm Tata Consultancy Services , Tata Steel , and Tata Motors , which together contribute about 90 per cent of total group profits . Among the activities dropped were cosmetics , soaps , publishing , cement , textiles , and joint ventures making personal computers and process controls . Tea gardens in Assam and South India have been sold to new companies majority-owned by staff . Foreign investment in this sector is intensely political , with local shopkeepers and politicians resisting entry of foreign retail chains .

Jaguar had not introduced new products for 10 years , and SUVs like those made by Land Rover were suddenly regarded as antisocial . ' ' It was just sucking in cash , ' ' Tata said .

' ' Today it 's as profitable if not more than profitable as the parent company , Tata Motors , ' ' Tata said . New products are on the way , including an ' ' entry level ' ' Jaguar , a Jaguar roadster to revive the old linkage of the brand with motor sports , and a crossover sedan-SUV .

6,@@1650581,2010,Tata,"<h> Greenpeace Takes Heart From Vedanta About a month after Vedanta 's mining project in Niyamgiri , in eastern Orissa , was brought to a halt after failing to clear government environmental approvals , environmental group Greenpeace is alleging that the Ministry of Environment and Forests has double standards because it is letting a port project in the same state proceed as planned . For the past six years Greenpeace has been somewhat unsuccessfully spearheading a campaign against a deep-water port along the coast of Orissa . The first one , Dhamra Port , a joint venture between Tata Steel Ltd. and Larsen &amp; Toubro , is scheduled to begin operations at the end of the year . ( One of their efforts involves a Pacman-style video game , over which Tata is now suing them for trademark violation ) . In a press conference held Thursday , Greenpeace activist Ashish Fernandes said that the "" government is selectively applying forest and environmental laws to corporations , "" implying that the Government was being partial to Tata . Advertisement Greenpeace is fighting against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one of which is a breeding ground for the endangered Olive Ridley sea turtles , while another is home to saltwater crocodiles . The environmental group believes industrial activity and increased human presence in the area will affect the nesting of these animals . An environmental assessment of the location carried out in 1999 , when the port was first proposed , gave the project a clean bill of health , Tata has previously said , but Greenpeace disputes that assessment . In response to a Right-to-Information request filed by an environmental activist , the government released documents that showed that an Orissa office of the federal environment ministry had told the latter that the port violated the Forest Conservation Act , Mr. Fernandes said . Last year the Supreme Court referred the matter to a special committee after three conservationists filed an application asking the court to take action under the Forest Conservation Act . The federal ministry in a letter to the special committee disagreed with this allegation and the Orissa office 's finding . The special committee ' report , which was made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ federal ministry 's stand saying that the project did not violate forest protection laws . Officials at the central environment ministry could not be reached for comment . Tata has previously told India Real Time that it stands by the 1999 assessment and the project adheres to forest laws . An official from the Dhamra Port Construction Ltd. joint venture declined to comment . However , the website of Dhamra Port says the port area is "" sufficiently away from the limits of both Gahirmatha Sanctuary and National Marine Sanctuary , which includes ' core ' as well as ' buffer ' area with reference to turtle congregation . "" The Dhamra port is scheduled to open at the end of the year , according to Tata . But Greenpeace appears to be hoping that by drawing parallels between Vedanta and this port project , they can draw fresh attention to their movement . Abhimanyu Bhandari , of the law firm Axon Partners , did n't seem very sure that this strategy would work . "" Because the government gives its clearance in one part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's being partial , "" said Mr. Bhandari , who advises business clients on environmental issues . "" Accusing the government of being unfair is a reckless allegation to make because each case has its individual intricacies and impacts . "" The Dhamra Port Project in my opinion is not only one of the most pathbreaking industrial initiatives for the State of Orissa but also one of the most responsibly undertaken . For quite some time , dissenters like Greenpeace have been raising voice against port development on the grounds that the nesting of Olive Ridley Trurtles would be adversely affected . It has been proved beyond doubt , both scientifically and by Nature 's own rules , that such a fear is absolutely unfounded . The activities at Dhamra stringently follow rules and norms set down by IUCN and here several measures have been employed in order to safeguard the nesting habitat of turtles , including the use of turtle deflectors and special turtle-friendly lighting at the port . Also , the main fact is that the actual port site is far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouths that create a natural barrier . The Port Project has also been welcomed by the people of the region as it has brought about significant improvement in their socio-economic condition and holds more promises for the Future . In both 2009 and 2010 , the beaches of Gahirmatha have seen turtles flocking in record numbers , perhaps with the mission to prove that nature and industry can always co-exist peacefully if proper accountability is maintained . Check out this video - http : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=eXJ9x8sEQQ to know more about the Port and also about Arribada . It has already been proved more than once that Greenpeace would not stop from resorting to the vilest means to attract publicity to any campaign they have started . Even if that campaign may not have any element of justification to it whatsoever . In the matter of port construction at Dhamra too , the NGO has resorted to meaningless emotional outbursts without heeding to any scientific reasoning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for which it faced strict consequences from the Orissa Government , Greenpeace has contributed precious little to the cause of the environment . This time , the lies of Greenpeace stand exposed yet once again . A letter of Government of Orissa , from year 2000 clearly states that the port area of Orissa does not come under any forestland . Therefore there has not been any violation of the provisions mentioned in Forest Conservation Act . This confirmation has been received in 2000 , at a time when Tata Steel had not been a part of the venture at all . It is a definite proof that Greenpeace has misrepresented facts from the beginning . They have wanted to prolong the agitation and conveniently overlooked the fact that the actual port site at Dhamra is far removed from the nesting habitat of the Olive Ridley Turtles . It is really time for Greenpeace to curb their lying habits and become more responsible in matters concerning the environment . A Greenpeace Membership could land you in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innocuous but in future , with a membership with organizations like Greenpeace you may have to say practically goodbye to studying , immigrating or visiting the US simply because you could be in their terror database . With the US in the lead can other countries not but follow suit ? Why ? There are indications that the world might be finally losing its patience with the increasing trend of eco-terrorism that flows from the Greenpeace type model of protests . The tipping point apparently had been the twin events of the Discovery Channel hostage crisis in the US and Greenpeace 's unconstitutional assault on an oil rig in Greenland that had their respective governments fuming . A new report by terrorism researchers at the University of Maryland concludes that the deadly hostage-taking incident at the Discovery Communications headquarters in suburban Washington , D.C. meets the criteria of a terrorist act . And why this report is significant is that they happen to be the wing of Homeland Security Department of the US government . The year 2009-10 , India suffered its worst drought in almost four decades , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the photo , Greenpeace activists then hung an 80-foot banner from the Mumbai-Thane Bridge addressed to the Indian prime minister on June 4 , 2009 . It requested him to save our monsoons given the drought situation . How mischievous this tactic is illustrated by their article 29th June 2009 , titled "" It 's anomaly reigning "" posted 29th June 2009 in the Greenpeace India website - just a few days after this stunt : "" On assessing the historical data , the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in its fourth Assessment Report suggested , "" warming in India is likely to be above the average for South Asia , with an increase in summer precipitation and an increase in the frequency of intense precipitation in some parts . "" That the Indian monsoons are going to undergo gross changes as a direct result of climate change -- rainfall will increase by 20 per cent overall in the summer monsoon , but the distribution of this increase will not be evenly spread across the country . "" So what 's Greenpeace 's actual position any way ? Does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both . This is not strange , as global warming according to its proponents can do almost everything and anything like simultaneously making sea water more salty and less salty ! But it does not matter really as global warming or CO2 has nothing to do with monsoon intensity . But it finds a perfect 1:1 correlation fit with ENSO - El Nino ( La Nina ) Southern Oscillation . However , if the IPCC painted scenario had only been true , an increase by 20% in rainfall could have given India a double digit growth rate for agriculture and at least double of that in terms of GDP . Such stupendous growth could have wiped out the face of poverty within 5-10 years in our country . If this is "" climate change "" , Indians should be welcoming it with open arms . But alas , more than a decade has passed after the IPCC had predicted such a scenario but we find practically no such change in our rainfall long period average ( LPA ) . The LPA , even factoring the current "" exceptional "" summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This typical means justify end tactics not only eats into the credibility of not only Greenpeace but the entire NGO and environmental organizations . What public credibility has NGO/environment groups left with if NGOs and environmental groups pursue advocacy clams that have no factual basis ? If they tout they follow evidence based M&amp;E then they should ensure their advocacy campaigns reflect this value as well . Do you work for TATAs Subham ? Tata Steel has over the years addressed all issues of environment with total commitment and utmost priority . So when Greenpeace raised objections against the development of a deep-sea port in Dhamra , Orissa on the ground that it would adversely affect the vulnerable Olive Ridley Turtles ' nesting habitat , port expansion work was stalled for a year during which all concerns were suitably addressed . Recommendations from International Union of Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) which happens to be one of the world 's most renowned scientific organisations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specialists were effectively implemented . It may be noted that IUCN and the MTSG ( Marine Turtle Scientific Group ) scientists working with the group have clearly stated that dredging operations for Dhamra does not and will not affect the Olive Ridley Turtles in Gahirmatha Marine Sanctuary and its periphery area . Tata Steel since 2004 has initiated several discussions with Greenpeace &amp; other such organisations regarding the port development along with continuous discussions with the local communities including the fishermen population . Even IUCN had a stakeholders meet in February 2009 wherein Govt of India , Govt of Orissa , Wild Life Institute of India , Local Communities , Scientists &amp; Civil Society organisations participated . However , Greenpeace , who continue to invent lies in their Dhamra campaign , has abused the transparency and the co-operation always extended by Tata Steel . In an earlier instance as well , Greenpeace misrepresented a report prepared by the North Orissa University on their website , after failing to conduct their own impact assessment study on the port .

So we are here expecting some increase in the prices by about 5% to 7% over the next 30 days , maybe more . Now coupled with that we have seen severe rupee depreciation in the last one month and that has made imports completely sort of unviable or inaccessible for the time being . That should be a good news for the domestic industry . We are not seeing a very strong domestic demand before a couple of months . I am excluding the monsoon period , but the demand should also look stronger on the back of this depreciation of the rupee and falling of imports . So in a nutshell , it would fuel the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next few months and that can definitely give some hope about price rise , at least by 5% to 7% , immediately and maybe 10% in the next couple of months or so . ET Now : You seemed to have answered my question briefly , but just to dwell more upon the rupee depreciation and what this is going to do to your exports . Do you think that there is going to be a major boost not just for your company but for the sector as a whole and if you could quantify that ? Ajay Bhatt : Well , if you see the impact of the rupee depreciation , we will have to see it in the context of how it is impacting the prices . Like India imports all of coking coal , so coking coal prices will go up for all the steel producers , ingenerated players , and on the export front , yes , there would be benefit . So when we take into account the price impact on the coking coal alone , the raw material prices are going up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the iron ore globally . That will also reflect in the domestic industry . So both the raw material costs have gone up , have to actually translate into the end product. ? So that is the impact of rupee depreciation on the raw materials . Now , how it is going to impact on the sales , on the prices ? As I told you , the domestic prices should definitely move up because imports will get actually cultivated now or maybe we may not see some imports in the next few months . It will equally help the export prices as well , but the export prices would be dependent on the global demand of steel , but rupee depreciation will definitely factor into the export prices , that is going to be quite helpful . So the rupee depreciation is equalising the impact of some increase in the price of end products by the raw material imports , but yes , with the demand having gone up , the players who have domestic access to the raw materials will be benefited exclusively by the rupee depreciation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer speak about the possibility of a price hike . In fact , you seem to be believing that it is fairly certain . How soon can this happen because there are lots of murmurings of Rs 800 to 1000 per tonne price hike happening any time soon ? You think this could happen as early as this week ? Ajay Bhatt : It can happen anytime now and may be in the next few days you will definitely see some announcement coming in from some major players like JSW or Tata Steel . It should definitely happen in the next few days . I do not think there is any time left and the coincidence of this price increase is also the fact that the monsoons are going to come to end . We have a forecast that rains are going to end from 27th or 28th of this month . So definitely the demand in the system is going to revive and coupled with the price increase , it will be quite helpful for the steel industry . The price increase should immediately come in the next few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe a couple of months if the rupee continues to remain in the current range .","Class: Financial, Family: Economic Variables, comment: Commodity Price Fluctuation, India imports all of coking coal, so coking coal prices will go up for all the steel producers... the raw material prices are going up... iron ore globally. That will also reflect in the domestic industry.  So when we take into account the price impact on the coking coal alone , the raw material prices are going up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the iron ore globally . That will also reflect in the domestic industry. The increase in raw material costs (coking coal, iron ore) due to rupee depreciation is a clear commodity price fluctuation risk.
Class: Financial, Family: Economic Variables, comment: Inflation, Rupee depreciation will definitely factor into the export prices and the raw material costs have gone up. The cost-push effect of rising raw material prices because of the weaker rupee can fuel inflation within Tata's cost structure.
Class: Environmental, Family: Extreme Weather, comment: Tropical Windstorm and Flood, ""Monsoons generally remain very subdued for steel prices and this year monsoons have been very intense, very thorough."" The intense monsoon rains are environmental events (heavy rain / potential flooding) that affect steel demand and logistics.
Class: Governance, Family: Process Risks, comment: Supply Management, The supply constraints are giving this price rise. Supply constraints are mentioned as an industry-wide issue leading to price fluctuations and potential bottlenecks.
Class: Geopolitical, Family: Business Environment (Country Risk), comment: Logistics Restrictions, Imports will get actually cultivated now or maybe we may not see some imports in the next few months. A logistics restriction arises because imports are no longer viable economically (too expensive because of rupee fall), affecting steel supply chains.

The state government , which was to renew 26 lapsed leases operating under a deemed extension is in the process of sending notices to mine owners including Tata Steel , Rungta , Aditya Birla company 's Essel Mining and KJS Ahluwalia and Stemcore 's Aryan Mining and trading Corporation asking why their lease applications should not be rejected . As per a Supreme Court order the state was to renew the leases or reject the long-pending applications before Novembre 15 . The move had mine owners rushing to New Delhi for crisis management . The development can further delay the resumption of iron ore mines in the state which accounted for almost half the country 's production last year .

Even larger companies such as Tata Steel ( whose Jamshedpur plant is significantly dependent on theses mines ) have been forced to import iron ore .

Odisha 's move to only allow renewals to mine owners who had a downstream , sponge iron or steel plant , and to the extent of what the plant would consume over the next 30 years was stayed by the tribunal under the Mines Ministry and the High Court of Odisha .
